  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Magentix - The 4th Birthday Saturday 10th September 2011.11pm-7am. September may be the start of the winter again, the days may be getting shorter and the temperature getting colder, but the line up we have in store for you will have you sweating more than you have been all summer. Brett Wood 2011 has been another mighty year for Brett Wood. Gaining signings from various labels and compilations as well as picking massive support up from the likes of Armin Van Buuren, Above &amp; Beyond, Markus Schul...z and Gareth Emery to name just a few! Now concentrating on just his power trance sound he will show you why he is now a sought after artist with a bang! His trance with bollox sound has seen labels such as Slinky, Joyride, Nukleuz and Recoverworld releasing his work as well as Brett&#8217;s label Direct Drive Recordings. His electric banging style has graced superclubs such as Gatecrasher &amp; Slinky already and thats just the start in Brett Wood&#8217;s eyes! Ian O'shea Early in 2011 Ian O&#8217;Shea introduced himself to the dance music scene with his debut single &#8216;Star Vision.&#8217; Having been personally mentored by internationally acclaimed and award-winning music producer, DJ and record label owner K90 makes it no wonder that Ian's production skills have rapidly gained him the respect of music fans, DJs and producers alike. Pathfinder The man behind the legendary 'Trance on the Themes' and resident and promoter for 'Spangulation' - Richard Brownlee, aka, Pathfinder, has been tearing up trance floors all over London for many-a-years. His unique and wide diversity in trance sounds is certainly something of a rarity and fits in with the magnetix music policy to perfection. Kito A dj who has promoted more parties in the past than most DJs have played at, Kito presently promotes 'Dance Tribe'. He's held residencies at Antiworld, Colours and also his own party Peace. Being known by London clubbers at various events for playing a wide variety of dance music, Kito will be joining us here at Magnetix to unleash some of his menacing psychedelic sounds. Residents Not forgetting to mention the mighty likes of the regular team uniting the trances as one, Lorenzo Barrero will be on the uplifting front, Dean Zone on the powerful european edge and Phil Lankester and Neill Moore smashing it up with their psychedelic sounds, if trance is what you like, believe us when we say 'we know trance'. Playing the best in Psy, Hard and Euphoric Trance! (set times will be announced shortly) - watch this space.....

Regular performers throughout the early years included luminaries such as Noel Coward, Marlene Dietrich and Louise Brooks, who made history when she introduced the Charleston to London at the venue in 1924. Caf&#233; survived a devastating bombing in World War II, and has continued to provide the backdrop for many of London&#8217;s wildest moments ever since.

  <short_description>How does it feel to have your world blown apart</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;How does it feel to have your world blown apart? Britain is booming and Molly moves to London from deepest Cornwall full of naive dreams, high hopes and on a quest to make her life just like the movies. Then on 7/7/2005, she finds herself on a tube blown up by terrorists and her life is forced to take a different direction. Funny, frank and poetic; this is the true story of what happened next and how we put things back together after they&#8217;ve been blown apart.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

She's not done too badly. She's the best and she wants everyone to know it, so she's gonna keep shouting until you notice her! Either that, or sleep with Justin Bieber. Come see for yourself.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;It's all tease, no sleaze as couture corsets killer heels and stockings aplenty combine exquisitely with music from across the decades to recall glamour days gone by. Traditional burlesque is given a modern day tweak as sultry vocals, breathtaking choreography, mischief, magic, frivolity and fun collide. Sorry over 18s only!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Amir Sharma&#8217;s portrayal of Michael Jackson in his prime has to be the most vocally and visually accurate tribute to the King of Pop to have ever toured UK theatres. Amir is joined on the stage by a cast of musicians, singers and dancers who work their way through all the hits. He&#8217;s got the look, the moonwalk and above all, the voice! His renditions of Thriller, Beat it and Billie Jean are truly sensational. Pure MJ&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>
