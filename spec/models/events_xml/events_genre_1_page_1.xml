  <short_description>Jerico Orchestra is a collective of musicians and sound artists dedicated to exploring the relationship between visual art and music. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Its aim is to encourage its participants to interact in radically different ways by expanding both the concept and form of a musical score. Our performances consist of three elements united together: the collective mind of the orchestra in action, the projected score, and the response of the audience. Together these three elements create a unique work which must be experienced in its totality, live and living, acting on both spatial and conceptual levels, (moving from feeling into meaning) releasing aesthetic responses into involvement with collective consciousness. We believe there is a close relationship between aesthetics and ethics; and that collaborative creative effort is nothing less than an aesthetic model for an achievable political programme.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Midweek-marvellous-music event at Punk Nightclub, your feet will not be able to keep still to this sexy pop night...</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Amy Love gives you the diary of an Essex girl mapped out over 21st century rock n roll blueprints kneaded and twisted into a big city fanfare by her team of loyal acolytes. In the studio every knob is twisted to ensure a miasma of fuzz guitar, big beats and dark sci-fi filters to back up her wide screen vocals and unputdownable choruses Live its down and dirty with a supatite punky three piece cutting a swathe through the action as she struts the stage, occupying a space somewhere between vintage Iggy, Debbie Harry and maybe Pink on a good night. Formed in Feb 2010 from a diverse background of musical genres, the London based Always Scarlett combine soaring melodies, catchy guitar riffs and diverse rhythms. A strong, sassy band with great hooks &#8211; what more could you want? ZED play electo funk, soul and house and are determined to make the audience dance. Coming from a wide variety of backgrounds including Gospel, Industrial, Electronica and Funk the boys of Zed formed to bring dance to a live arena. They have been gigging throughout London and enjoy creating a party wherever they go. Born in the land down under and raised in London, Kieran Ayres (rhymes with chairs, bears and stairs) brings a sense of innovation to the UK rock and pop scene. After plying his trade in bands from a young age, he has developed an ability to sing and perform with an energy and verve that will cut right to the senses of everyone who likes music of the rocking variety. Rhys Williams - His work was described as &#8216;striking&#8217; on Radio 4, &#8216;delightful&#8217; in Q Magazine and &#8216;horrific&#8217; in the NME. It also led to two internet death threats. Join us for a night of funky pop-rock music on Wednesday 31st August 2011. http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/user/?region=gb_london&amp;query=detail&amp;event=461423&amp;interface=feedmemusic&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Van Downham sound specialises in combining vocal harmonies with great musicianship, producing a result which has been likened to The Eagles.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Van Downham have achieved massive success across Europe over the past 15 years, in particular Eastern Europe where they appeared on Polish TV, including the Miss Intercontinental Contest aired live. Adding to that countless huge festivals and stadium gigs. The band, who's lead singer hails from the North West of England, are now increasing their exposure in the UK and are in talks with Universal Records in America. Joining them t...his summer is the writer, producer and guitar legend, Jerry Donahue, well known for his work in the UK Folk Rock having graced the records of many well known acts that include Fotheringay, Fairport Convention, The Yardbirds, The Proclaimers, Joan Armatrading, Chris Rea, The Hellecasters and The Beach Boys. Jerry Donahue, the "guitarist's guitarist", or as the late great Danny Gatton christened him, "the string bending king of the planet". The Van Downham sound specialises in combining vocal harmonies with great musicianship, producing a result which has been likened to The Eagles. The show features some great songs including Orange Blossom Special, plus self penned tracks from Van Downham. Also in the show expect to hear the great tracks from Donahue including Around The Bend and Rocking The Dog, plus for Jerry fans there will be a special question and answer session where he will take questions from the audience, Jerry comments 'Its' great doing a Q &amp; A session in the show, you never know what your going to have to answer. Last time it was like show and tell at school &#8211; I love it!'.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Jazz in london with the John Law Trio at Pizza Express, the 31st of August.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;As a contrast to his on-going Art of Sound trio, which plays exclusively his own compositions, this new trio project will feature, as well as some of John's most melodic trio compositions, also arrangements of jazz standard repertoire and the odd unusual tune from further afield like Sting or Nick Drake. Some interesting new arrangements but with the emphasis on time, swing and grooves, and, in contrast to the AOS (appearing at this year's famous North Sea Jazz Festival in Rotterdam!), which features unusual sounds in the way of added electronic effects and instruments such as the hang and the glockenspiel, this trio goes back to the classic piano, bass, drums format.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Jazz in London the 1st of Septembre at Pizza Express with the brilliant artist Marius Neset</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Marius Neset is increasingly regarded as a major emerging voice on the European jazz scene, and his second album (released in the spring on Edition Records) more than justifies the acclaim that is coming his way. The Norwegian saxophonist makes his instrument dance like a gazelle and soars like an eagle. It&#8217;s not just the virtuoso technique that impresses; although that is already at a level few saxophonists can live with. Nor is it just Neset&#8217;s distinctiveness as a composer. Both these aspects are part of a package that is given shape and focus by that indefinable extra factor that adds up to a unique musical personality.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Djs playing rock n roll, indie, classic rock and alternative from 6pm. Live bands start at 9pm. lisitngs to follow. FREE ENTRY!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;"Keep on......Rockin in the Free World" said Neil Young in 1989 22 years later... The Arc has decided to Rock in its own free world every friday night. To start things off at 6pm The Arc's very own Slapstick Djs will serve you up a whole host of indie, rock, classic rock and alternative records. we do take requests...though only good music thank you! ...at 9pm the first of our bands take to the stage. Turnpike Glow Turnpike Glow started life in Rome in a scene marginalised by glossy Italian mainstream pop and insider trading. But with their Pavement-Phoenix inspired sound they soon found themselves supporting acts like Cooper Temple Clause, The Futureheads and The Constantines. In 2007 they started flying over to do live shows in London, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester. It soon became clear that the UK was where the band could find a receptive audience and so the songwriting core of the band, Sandro and Giuseppe, moved to London armed with just their guitars and lots of European plug adaptors. One rainy Sunday they bumped into Anthony and James busking on the tube in giant sombreros. They talked, they laughed and eventually, they joined forces&#8230; + More TBA What's in it for you: good music. the odd free shot of Jager (if you're close to the bar at least) a couple of free slices of pizza &#163;2 Jager fun shelter and hopefully a hangover in the morning! join us! Rockin Noah Captain of the good ship hammered&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Phantom Limb, Size Nine and Nuke Bnana Three great bands take to the stage as STAND! throws a showcasing party night. Enthralling southern soul from Phantom Limb plus horn-fuelled Latin funk from Size Nine AND dance floor beats courtesy of Nuke Bnana STOP PRESS DJ Dave Koors will also be appearing to provide the soundtrack for the night! Headlining are Phantom Limb, with their own take on southern soul, carrying some beautiful gospel and country influences with them. Inspiration from Aretha Franklin, the Band and the Staple Singers gives this Bristol based outfit the delicacy to convey the type of honesty that "only comes from singing about the truth". One of BBC London presenter Robert Elms' albums of 2010, it is easy to see why artists such as Candi Staton, Solomon Burke, The Avett Brothers and more recently Rumer have requested Phantom Limb support them. To see and hear more, click here http://www.phantomlimbmusic.co./video/. Support comes from Size Nine and Nuke Bnana Size Nine is an eight piece band from South London. They combine the tightest rhythm section and the rowdiest horns behind the gritty, thought-provoking lyrics and soulful tones of Brixton's finest songstress, Breezy Lee Ethelion. Nuke Bnana is the brain child of another Brixtonian - this time DJ/musician Jonny Bolax. New for 2011 STAND! sought some help from Mr Bolax to describe his band - "With a blend of extreme syncopation, tribal sonics and challenging lyrics, this new group is sure to contort dance floors from here to Uranus." Thanks Jonny! Doors 7pm / First act on stage 8pm / Tickets &#163;7 in advance &#163;9 on the door STAND! at the Fairfield Halls Launching with a new schedule of events, STAND! will be bringing headline contemporary music to the Arnhem Gallery - creating one of South London's largest flat floor music venues. The opening series of gigs features soul, funk, reggae, ska and R&amp;B and clearly shows the commitment to bringing diverse and renown artists to a much needed, genuine mid-sized venue in South London. With new staging, great lighting and sound, plus the Arnhem Gallery bar open, STAND! is not only generating an amazing response from the musicians involved but also great anticipation from gig-goers of some fantastic nights ahead.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;After a summer break It's All Happening are returning to the King's Head on Friday 2nd September, and with Yearbook, Barely Modern &amp; Control on the bill, it's going to be a good one!! &#163;4 in advance or before 8, &#163;5 after Tickets from King's Head, It's All Happening, and http://www.wegottickets.co&#8203;m/event/127452 Yearbook&#8217;s stutter and starts through their angular architecture has prompted numerous comparisons to Bloc Party, but with punk energy rather than pretentious attitudes. Their lyrical dexterity weaved with angst fuelled riffs is available for you to check out in advance, on their EP All Squares &amp; Circle, available to download freeeee. Barely Modern make the kind of scuzzy garage rock that has the music press periodically wetting their pants and predicting a return to the good old days of days of Albion. Originally from Slovenia, they now call London home, and It&#8217;s All Happening have already put money on success shaking their way. Control, five lads from South East London play songs that whirl along like bittersweet clouds of confetti, propulsive choruses being carried by catchy melodies. &#8216;Sea of Doubt&#8217; is as good a place as any to start your listening journey.

  <short_description>Join us at the legendary 100 Club for a night of awesome rock, pop and indie bands.  This is one live music event you do not want to miss!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Charlie Coombes and the New Breed were formed in the summer of 2009 and have been touring ever since. In 2010 they played in Europe and USA, including the SXSW festival. They also released 2 EPs: their debut "Panic" and the second EP "Waves", both to critical acclaim. Charly and the band continue to go from strength to strength as 2011 sees a new release later in the year, summer festival appearances, and a major UK tour. Morning Lane have consolidated their position as one of the best bands on the local London scene and in preparation for 2011, the band are currently in the process of building relationships with industry executives who will promote the band's music to a much wider audience through music placement and shows in front of much bigger audiences. With songs like She Dancer, How It Ends and Wake Up, Morning Lane have found their unique spot in the music scene that transcends their current fan base. With an international appeal and songs that resonate in people long after they leave a Morning Lane show, an air of imminent success is brewing. Take two parts pop, one part rock, add a splash of dance, and then pour over a valve amp. Korda Marshall is a London-based pop rock five-piece, blending infectious melodies with edgy guitars, pumping bass-lines and pounding drums. Consisting of five bold composition students, they knock their collective heads together to give their catchy, mainstream sound a sizzle, with an electrifying live show. Kid Kenosis are an indie-rock band from Northampton who, in their own words enjoy "preparing sounds that go in your ears, make your heart aflutter, and make your body want to jig." You don't want to miss this night!!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Want a night of amazing live rock music?  Then look no further, this event has it all and it is all wrapped up for you at the super-cool venue, 229.  Get ready to rock!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Jokers Dozen - formed in 2009, hailing from scenic east London, this gunslinging 6 piece are out to redress the balance for hard rock and bring the soul back to this ole town. Influenced by rock through the ages, from Zepp to ZZ, Metallica to Muse, and armed with a burning desire to put the spectacle back into live music, Joker's Dozen mean business and there is no rest for this wicked bunch. Led by guitar-driven riffs and a joker up their sleeves in the form of a Hammond, the band are currently undertaking shows in the capital. The &#8216;Dozen&#8217; are here and they&#8217;re ready to show their hand to live fast and save the rest for later. Bad Wolf is a 3 piece rock band from London. If you're a Dr. Who fan, you'll know where the name is from. If you don't, look it up! Enjoying a broad range of influences from Nirvana to Shostakovich, Metallica to The Smiths, Bad Wolf have been likened to "a cross between Muse and Arctic Monkeys on acid fronted by Morrisey". The boys don't necessarily agree with this, especially lead vocalist Simon, who is not from Manchester, has never had a quiff, and refuses to jam flowers in his back pocket. Any Bad Wolf fan will tell you, the band are as wicked as a Scooby-Doo bad guy. Catch them if you can. Superlungs, a young rock band with a story to tell. When Roger Daltrey first heard them he swore. Jimmy Page actually stood up and air guitared! And David Courtney (who discovered Leo Sayer) invited them to perform on his latest album, alongside Sir Paul McCartney and David Gilmour... They were once the youngest signed rock band in Europe, their first single reached No 19 in iTunes worldwide Essentials Chart and their songs have been used in a recent Hollywood production. The band's debut CD, six years in development, was recorded in the same studio and on the same analogue tape machines used by The Pretty Things and Arthur Brown for their most recent studio albums; all produced by Slade&#8217;s engineer. Superlungs are now getting stuck into the live circuit to promote their new album 'Nobody' and to establish the Superlungs name throughout the UK. It seems they have a very good head start! Miss it at your peril....&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Rich Mix have teamed up with Love Music Hate Racism to commemorate and celebrate the life of musician, poet and activist Gil Scott Heron. This honorary evening will include live poetry performance, music, talks and DJ sets celebrating his life and work. Gil Scott Heron is frequently referred to as the Godfather of Rap, although this is a title he disputed as equally as he disputed the claim that his music is solely about politics. He preferred to refer to himself as a &#8216;Bluesologist&#8217;. Scott Heron&#8217;s career spanned over forty years and included collaborations with many talented musicians including Brian Jackson and more recently with Jamie XX. There is no doubt that his music and poetry revolutionised the rap scene in the 1970s and still remains a strong influence for contemporary culture and the recent rise of spoken word. After his death many musicians, including Mos Def and Public Enemy have spoken out about how critical his work has been for the Hip Hop and Rap scenes. He was one of the first artists to use music to attack the apartheid in South Africa and has spoken up against racism, poverty and frequently battled for social change. One of his most famous songs &#8220;The Revolution will not be Televised&#8221; spoke out against passivity and many of the themes he touched upon in his lyrics such police violence, hope and allusions to television culture are still very relevant today. If we look around the world and even in our own community, the messages and themes that Gil Scott Heron was fighting for are still resonant in the present day. In his own words, here&#8217;s &#8220;To Better Days Ahead&#8221;. Love Music Hate Racism www.lovemusichateracism.com Gil Scott Heron www.gilscottheron.net&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two year old Ben Poole is currently being described the most exciting young blues guitarist to come out of the UK for a long, long time. The past year has been an extremely exciting one for Ben, seeing his name crop up regularly in Europe's biggest selling guitar magazine Total Guitar who recently named Ben as "the guitarist to watch out for in 2010". Ben has also realised a lifelong dream to play with one of his favourite living musicians &#8211; US guitarist/singer/songwriter Richie Kotzen, touring with him on Richie's October 2009 UK tour. With the release of the five track EP EVERYTHING I WANT, produced by none other than esteemed guitarist Bernie Torme (Ozzy Osbourne, Ian Gillan), Ben Poole will now get his unique virtuoso guitar playing out to a far wider audience and will surely become the name to drop when talking about new, young and gifted blues/rock guitarists. Of the five tracks on the EP, four are from the pen of Ben Poole, the only cover being a blistering rendition of the Paul Rodgers/Andy Fraser penned&#65279;.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Whybirds, from Bedford, bring their Pearl Jam meets The Allman Brothers sound to Cargo in London for a headline show on Saturday 3 September 2011.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Classic Rock journalist Derek Oliver said: &#8220;If you are at all interested in alt.country rock then you&#8217;ll love The Whybirds. They have it all; songs, musicianship and a sense of maturity that most acts of this kind can&#8217;t even comprehend. I&#8217;ve lost count of the amount of times that Q, Uncut or Word magazine has banged on about alt-country artists to hear music that sounds like its been recorded in a bathroom by clueless embryonic singer/songwriters. &#8220;These guys are the real deal &#8211; think Flying Burrito Brothers, Tom Petty and The Band. Better looking than the early Eagles and every inch as determined, you&#8217;ll be hearing more of these guys some time soon.&#8221; According to Americana UK, The Whybirds &#8220;&#8230;sound like Pearl Jam having a fist fight with The Allman Brothers in Don Henley&#8217;s back yard. But what&#8217;s more important is that The Whybirds might just be the hardest working and hardest rocking band in Britain right now &#8211; a band destined for greatness&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>80's indie cult band The Band Of Holy Joy follow-up their Glastonbury Festival appearance with a London headline show.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Forever changing, consistently unique yet, always somehow the same, The Band Of Holy Joy began life as gutter chansoniers using junk shop instruments to propagate a brute romantic madly literate form of dispossessed urban folk music. Since then the band have scaled a few heights fallen down in one or two gutters, broken up, glued themselves together, toured the world, released a fair few albums for the likes of Rough Trade and fully explored other media by presenting two audio visual song plays: Troubled Sleep at the Shunt Theatre in London 2008 and an Invocation for William Burroughs at the Sorbonne Paris in 2009. They have set up their own label and Internet radio station Radio Joy. These days the junk shop instruments of old are long gone, and guitars, violins and visuals very much to the fore. But the band continues to write about the same outsider concerns with the same measure of spirit and care and man, they still put on a show. The Band of Holy Joy &#8211; forever changing, consistently unique, always the same. Join the adventure as they pass through your town.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

However, Ronda are a 4 piece Indie rock band who claimed the number 6 spot in the BBC Introducing songs of 2010. Ronda appeared at a number of festivals including the Worcester music festival, Wyside music festival (on the same bill as The Strangers) recording live &amp; aired on BBC Radio's Introducing show &amp; SnodFest, recorded live &amp; also aired on BBC Radio's Introducing show. Ronda have been described as Radiohead meets Travis with strong original commercially appealing songs. Andrew Marston of BBC Radio's Friday session 'Ronda have continued producing a high standard of material'.

The band won the mantle of best band in Herefordshire &amp; Worcestshire as voted by Wyvern FM listeners in 2009. Andy O'Hare of BBC Introducing saying expect big things from this band this year. Sounds of Grandeur from new kids on the block, We Are Embassy. The idea of operatic electronic beats mashed up with thrashy indie sounds a rather odd mix, but somehow Colchester musicians We Are Embassy make it work. Fronted by Matt Wye, We Are Embassy is a motley crew of ages and musical tastes. Bassist Rob norris, drummer Andy Clements and guitarist Mike Crotty complete the line up of the towns hottest new act. FAITHNFURY are a hard hitting 3 Piece rock band from south london. The band quickly took to the stage just a few short months after forming in late 2008. With a huge riffs, addicitive vocal melodies and an attention grabbing stage show that leaves you jumping around whilst wondering how a 3 piece can make such a massive sound, this band has grown from strength to strength and they just keep coming! Steve Leonard heads up this band with his huge voice and guitar skills, perfectly driven by the exciting drumming of Rich Bladon all wrapped up and fronted by Pace on the bass and backing vocals. This band have a close linked and very professional dynamic that never fails to impress. Constantly recording and gigging with bigger venues, crowds and events always in the pipeline this band is something you just have to check out!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

With initial inspiration drawn from reggae and dance hall, Strobe soon began incorporating the very best of various musical styles and digital effects which compliment the eclectic vocals. DJ Wombat :Expect Balinese Gamelans &amp; Southern Soul amongst the delights from Moodswinger grant showbiz - never predictable even 2 himself the only certainty will be a lack of Heavy Metal &amp; hopefully more than one moment when your synapses smirk &amp; chortle and the Joy of it All.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Sad Lovers &amp; Giants SAD LOVERS &amp; GIANTS play classy, alternative pop music. their multi-layered, many-faceted songs have been described by such words as &#8216;psychedelic&#8217;, &#8216;moody&#8217;, &#8216;exciting&#8217;, &#8216;wistful&#8217;, and &#8216;brooding&#8217;. Sweeping keyboards and dramatic piano; chugging, chiming, and eclectic guitars; inventive, melodic bass lines and steady drums with colourful embellishments all contribute to the depth of their sound. integrated into this are the vocals; sometimes confidential, sometimes forceful; always balancing the mood of the charismatic, often mysterious, lyrics. Like the music, the lyrics work on many levels. Just when you think you've unravelled the meaning of a song, another possibility presents itself&#8230; SAD LOVERS &amp; GIANTS&#8217; music is food for the imagination, a film without pictures, to transport you to other, but very real, worlds; or another dimension of our own. Commonplace, everyday situations are studied from different viewpoints at a tangent to reality.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Swingin' Utters + Moral Dilemma + The Exposed + JD &amp; The FDC's</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;One of the more traditional-sounding of California&#8217;s punk revival bands, Swingin&#8217; Utters formed in the late &#8217;80s around a first-name-only lineup of vocalist Johnny, guitarists Max and Darius, bassist Kevin, and drummer Greg. Originally based in Santa Cruz, these street punks later moved to San Francisco and recorded for several different labels, including Side One, IFA Records, and New Red Archives. The group first released 1992&#8242;s Scared as Johnny Peebucks &amp; the Swingin&#8217; Utters, but things really started to happen for them three years later with their full-length The Streets of San Francisco. The album garnered the band much attention, including Best Debut Album at the Bay Area Music Awards, and Swingin&#8217; Utters soon found themselves on the first annual Vans Warped Tour.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

We also celebrate the launch of Nascente Record&#8217;s Beginner&#8217;s Guide To Latin America &#8211; a 3CD exploration of some classic and contemporary Latin American rhythms compiled by Movimientos&#8217; very own Cal Jader, with copies to give away on the night. DJs Cal Jader and Arias continue to make Movimientos one of the most forward thinking Latin nights in the capital with their selection of new and old school Latin rhythms from Salsa and Cumbia to Tropical bass, Brazilian, Urban and electronic beats. Live music comes from a diverse selection of London based acts from the Latin and global music scene. 7Suns is a group whose music is an energizing blend of Afro-Latin, Caribbean, funk, jazz &amp; rock with strong melodies and up-tempo rhythms and played with a deliciously danceable quality and fantastic rock intensity. Remolino Quieto is the brainchild of established Cuban singer and songwriter Ramsay Estevez whose band, featuring some of London&#8217;s top Cuban players, combines his Latin spirit with folk and reggae influences http://www.soundcloud.com/ramsayandthereptiles Namvula Rennie is a singer songwriter who explores her Zambian-Scottish roots through her music. Her evocative songs speak of love and life, belonging and wandering, musically combining jazz, folk and African music. http://www.soundcloud.com/namvula&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Spooky Men's Chorale have entertained audiences across the globe with dry-witted songs about power tools, idiosyncratic arrangements of Queen songs, as well as traditional Georgian music, which forms a major influence on their compositions. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;An all-ages show. Based in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales and led by Stephen Taberner, the Spooky Men's Chorale is a vast, rumbling, steam powered, black-clad behemoth, seemingly accidentally capable of rendering audiences moist eyed with mute appreciation or haplessly gurgling with merriment. Based on the twin pillars of grand foolishness and the quest for the perfect subwoofer-rattling boofchord, the Spooky Men seek to commentate on the absurdity and grandeur of the modern male armed only with their voices, a sly collection of hats and a staggering diversity of facial hair configuarations. They have performed to general delirium at most Australian festivals, conquered the inner sanctums of the ABC, and also pillaged the UK to even more devastating effect in 2006 and 2007. They now have two CDs to offer an unsuspecting public, "Tooled Up", and "Stop Scratching it". It is unclear what is more dangerous to your general equilibrium, missing them, or not.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;From Roma to rumba, Latin beats to Afro funk, new folk to no folk, Global Local brings you the best emerging musical remix talent the UK has to offer. We pride ourselves on rooting out the finest cutting-edge sounds which blend innovation and tradition. Produced by Continental Drifts Music and its partners, this ground breaking project consistently brings some of the best music around to festival stages throughout London and beyond. Continental Drifts continentaldrifts.co.uk Engine-Earz Experiment A fusion of traditional Asian beats with booming dubstep and screaming guitars. The Engine-Earz Experiment are smashing what they see as 'glass divides between genres and ideologies'; fusing indigenous musics from around the world with dubstep and elements of drum'n'bass, electronica and alternative rock. Celt Islam Celt Islam creates Sufi inspired Global Grooves to create a Meditative Dub that transfixes everybody who comes across it, to Electro-Dub driven Drum and Bass to satisfy the dance world. He is probably best known to date for his work in the Sufi-Dub genre which he is probably alone in trying to create and to help define as a sub-genre.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>A night of Chicago-style piano blues with musician and vocalist Eric Ranzoni, kindly sponsored by Four Roses Bourbon at the Nightjar. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Nightjar is delighted to host Master Blender Jim Rutledge from Four Roses Bourbon to enjoy our special cocktail of the evening in his honour. Live music will be presented by our latest resident pianist and singer Eric Ranzoni serving up Chicago-style blues. Eric Ranzoni is a skilled and versatile pianist with a warm singing voice and a knack to entertain. Eric has played the Blues (and Roots music in general) in numerous venues in the UK, with frequent stints abroad. Many of the musicians he's had the privilege to play with have worked with artists such as Eric Clapton, Memphis Slim, Dr. John, Freddie King, Jerry Lee Lewis, Jools Holland and George Harrison, just to mention a few. Other than with his own projects, Eric is also in great demand as a Blues session pianist, backing live top international musicians and singers, such as Mud Morganfield (the eldest son of Muddy Waters), Big Joe Louis, Bill Hurley ('The Inmates' singer) and guitar ace Otis Grand, besides several London-based Blues bands. http://www.ericranzoni.co.uk/ http://www.myspace.com/ericranzoni&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>tidal concerts presents: cannabis corpse + guest</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;tidal concerts presents: cannabis corpse Cannabis corpse was formed in the summer of 2006 as a way to express our love of smoking weed and listening to Cannibal corpse. We thought that combining the speed and intensity of death metal with outlandish stories involving marijuana monsters, weed cults ect. would be a fresh take on the genre. The songs for our first album "Blunted at birth" were recorded in Weedgrinders kitchen on a boss BR-600 in Richmond Va by Landphil and his brother Hallhammer on a shoestring budget. Some friends liked the sound of the demo so much they offered to put it out as the first release on the fledgling record label "Forcefield Records" and it received alot of positive feedback from the Death metal community. The band had its first live gig on April 20 2007 ( 420 ) enlisting axeman Nickropolis the following year and everyone in the band enjoyed playing the music so much more gigs followed. That same year production on the second full length album "Tube of the resinated" began and was released in 2008 by Forcefield records as well as Robotic empire. The band started to play live much more often at this point doing several tours of the east coast with bands such as Skeletonwitch and Infernal Stronghold. They also got the opportunity to play a role in the Movie " In The Loop" a satirical comedy staring James Gandolphini performing the song "sentenced to burn one" at the Black cat in Washington D.C. in 2009 the latest E.P called "The Weeding" was released on Tank crimes records, The Oct. of 2009 saw the band going on its first full U.S tour with the band RammingSpeed and in Feb. 2010 there first tour of Europe and the UK. Expect to see alot more from Cannabis corpse in the future and Smoke weed everyday!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Moss Project, featuring Moss Freed on guitar, fusing sounds of Indie and jazz </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Doors open at 7:30pm, music begins at 8pm Loyalty Card Holdlers - this concert applies to our loyalty card scheme &#8220;Exciting guitarist Moss Freed leads his Radiohead-tinged outfit through moody, cinematic sounds that blur the lines between folk, rock and jazz with imagination and flair.&#8221; TimeOut www.myspace.com/themosssextet THE MOSS PROJECT Moss Freed - Guitar Ruth Goller - Bass Marek Dorcik - Drums Alice Zawadzki - Voice/Violin Moss Freed formed The Moss Project whilst studying composition and performance at the renowned Berklee College of Music in Boston, to provide a platform for progressive and exciting new music. On returning to his hometown of Manchester, he established a group there under the same name who quickly established a monthly residency at Matt &amp; Phred&#8217;s Jazz Club. Their debut album, Vision, was released in 2009 on Apsara. The album won much critical praise being described as &#8220;a real achievement&#8221; by Bill Bruford and as &#8220;a fascinating and hypnotically satisfying album which demands repeated plays&#8221; by All About Jazz. The band has performed regularly in the UK and Europe over the past three years including the London Jazz Festival and Manchester International Jazz Festival and have completed several successful tours in the UK (Jazz Services supported) and Germany. They have also achieved radio play on Jazz FM, BBC Manchester and ALL FM. In September 2009, Moss made the move to London and quickly established himself as part of the thriving jazz scene. A new quartet evolved featuring several of the UK&#8217;s rising stars such as Acoustic Ladyland&#8217;s Ruth Goller, drummer Marek Dorcik and vocalist/violinist, Alice Zawadzki. The quartet plan to record a new album in September.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Formed by well-known Hungarian musicians, Kiscsillag often labels itself as &#8220;a hobby-band taken seriously&#8221;. All four members used to play at one point for the band called Kispal es a Borz, who gave an unforgettable live performance in London last year. Kiscsillag will team up with Mindpilot, a recently formed British alternative rock trio featuring Tom Clarkson, Andr&#225;s Simonits and Marty McCloskey (Sweet Savage). Their music is known for strong psychedelic vibes and innovative progressive elements. The improvisations and a wide dynamic and rhythmical range make their live shows entertaining and memorable. Expect a clash of generations and rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll cultures on stage @ Underworld.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>You're entering the Dickensian hip-hop world of Rotten Hill Gang, with tales of old &amp; new London - stories as putrid as decaying vegetables at the end of a day in Portobello Road market &amp; as uplifting &amp; elevating as the sun rising over the Westway.  </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Look out! Who's that behind you? Watch your pockets..! You are entering the Dickensian hip-hop world of the Rotten Hill Gang, with tales of old and new London - stories as putrid as decaying vegetables at the end of a day in Portobello Road market and as uplifting and elevating as the sun rising over the Westway. It all began with Dirty White's project, the "Rotten Hill Sound System"......Dirty White on the decks and local badman street poet, Reds on the mic. The several musicians involved in this labour of love had first come together when George Vjestica of Groove Armada had presented a weekly night at Ladbroke Grove's Pelican pub.With their crazy beats, they created an atmosphere like no other and caught the attention of Keyboard player/producer, Andr&#233; Shapps. The Rotten Hill Gang was born! Putting together - among other sources - snatches of such movie soundtracks and dialogue as Scarface and Once Upon A Time in America, mixed together with classic rock 'n' roll guitar-riffs, this crew of like-minded musical souls understood they were creating a sound that was utterly original, hugely compelling, and definitely addictive. With the sultry tones of Hollie Cook of the Slits and Hayley Smith, and with Mallet on the drums, the sound was complete. The creativity of the musicians caught the attention of Mick Jones, Charlene Spitteri and Hugh Morgan to name but a few. Going with the theme of "anything is possible", Dirty White approached celebrity jeweller, Stephen Webster to manage the band. He thought it was a joke......it wasn't. The Rotten Hill Gang debuted at the first Carbon Casino night. Even though on that occasion they only played a pair of songs - "Pick a pocket" and "Fed Up" - their unique sound was enhanced by a glamorous image of late 1890's loucheness, an element of which featured Andr&#233; Shapps as king of moustache waxing. That night at the first Carbon Casino, Andre played on a borrowed set of keyboards; unable to obtain them, he moved over to guitar for the subsequent six Carbon Casino shows. Very quickly, the Rotten Hill Gang had become one of the great live road-shows, comparable with soul outfits of the 1960s, or - more appositely - George Clinton's Funkadelic/Parliament. Their material dealt with the dubside of life in Notting Hill, reality with rhythm. With Special Guests: The Black Crayon Theatre, Bible John &amp; The Reptiles, Beta Rays Doors: 7 p.m. Tickets: &#163;8 on the door&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>A night of R&amp;B / Soulful pop </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;A night of R&amp;B / Soulful pop Victoria Green - 10.00pm R&amp;B / Soul Elle Jay - 9pm Elle started out vocally singing jazz lead, solo musical theatre pieces and vocals for a Christian band. Writing my own songs and completing a 1st class degree in English Literature, I started playing/singing my own original material and covers at acoustic cafe nights in Liverpool. I recorded two demos and in 2008, started gigging and showcasing original material around London with guitarist Dan Storey and an acoustic band. In December 08 I sang for David Grindrod and Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber, being shortlisted for a BBC show. In January 09 I formed my full electric band and we have since played all over London including at Caf&#233; de Paris, The Spice of Life and at The Cavern, Liverpool. My Lucky One (2009) and Addicted (2010) EPs are on sale from itunes, www.cdbaby.com, www.amazon.com and more and have received nationwide radio play and numerous featured artist slots. I have a forthcoming release with Elation records later this year. My biggest pop influences are Madonna, Britney Spears, Pink, Jewel and Delta Goodrum. My songs are catchy, moody, heartfelt and assertive. My ballads are likened to Delta and my dance tracks are likened to Madonna the most! I work with Elation Music, Deuce Promotions, UpAllNight, Substance, DeadOrAlive and Micky P Music Promotions. I currently also lead vocals at a Mayfair church and at private events. Check my page and website (www.thisisellejay.com) for upcoming shows and to buy my music!! Richie Syrett - 8.15pm Richie Syrett is a singer/songwriter currently plying his trade in Manchester, UK. His style, like his personality is characteristically laid back, blending mellow melodic guitar tones to distinctive vocals and harmonies. Richie&#8217;s music manages to maintain an accessible originality of it&#8217;s own whilst saluting a wide range influences across the Folk/Rock and Roots genres in particular, and retains a novel lyrical quality that avoids well-worn clich&#233;s and subject matter. Currently unsigned, he gains his following via a good deal of internet coverage and playing live whenever and wherever he can. He looks set to build on this after having recently independently released his debut album, which is now available Admission:&#163;5 http://www.substancegigs.com/showdetails.php?sid=88&amp;vid=&amp;pa=2 The Spice of Life is a Soho landmark, historic music venue and the perfect meeting place in the heart of London's West End.

  <short_description>Join us for an evening with percussionist and composer Adriano Adewale&#8217;s global fusion.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Adriano Adewale Percussion/vocals Kadialy Kouyate - Kora/vocals Marcelo Andrade - Sax/Flute/Rabeca Nathan Thomson - Double bass/Flute/Kalimba Doors open at 7pm for diners, music starts at 8pm Throw aside preconceived musical prejudices, abandon all attempts to catalogue: a rich chemistry of cultural influences is at work when the Adriano Adewale Group gets together on stage. Rooted in the musical traditions of Nigeria, Angola and Brazil and infused with contemporary European classical and jazz styles, percussionist and composer Adriano Adewale&#8217;s music is a global fusion of musical influences. He performs with his outstanding ensemble of international musicians: Australian Nathan Thomson on double bass and flute; Senegalese Kadialy Kouyate on kora and vocals; and Brazilian Marcelo Andrade, on flute, sax and rabeca. &#8220;Adriano Adewale boasts an imposing collection of firepower yet deploys it with rare restraint.&#8221; The Times Adriano formed the Adriano Adewale Group in 2007 to explore his own compositions with other accomplished musicians. Their music explores issues of history, identity and nature. The group has released their debut album SEMENTES (Seeds) in September '08. Produced by international Jazz ledgend Gilad Atzmon the album features Gilad Atzmon and virtuoso guitarist Antonio Forcione. Dine with this event?

  <short_description>Dark ballades, sea shanties, jigs for dancing and Cockney- Brechtian folk-punk cabaret from Burch</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Two exceptional bands, authenic musicians, speaking about the truth and live in London, the pubs and the sea.. sung and performed in the irresistable atmospheric haunt of old London town. This is exactly what a night out in the heart of old London town should be! Green Diesel "Why be a poor man on the land, when you'd be king at sea?" Green Diesel began irritating the neighbours in 2009 and have consistently torn Kentish venues apart with their energetic take on folk-rock. Inspired by the darker side of English folk, the band mix influences from across the musical spectrum and bring them to bear on tales of doomed Kentish ghost ships, cuckolded noblemen and more besides. Dark ballades, sea shanties and jigs for dancing. http://www.myspace.com/thegreendieseltheory plus Nigel Burch &amp; his Flea-Pit Orchestra Twisted skiffle, spit-and-sawdust vaudeville and Cockney-Brechtian folk-punk cabaret from Burch, the banjulele-bashing bard and his musical misfits including Dylan Bates, typsy gypsy fiddler extraodinaire, the Paganini of Penge. Manic minstrel Burch delivers his dark and gritty bittersweet ditties with wit and a vitriolic fervour. Violinist Bates adds an entertaining jazz-tinged playful poignancy - ...all underpinned with the slightly unhinged rythm section of Richard Lee (double bass) and Steve Blake (drums) http://www.reverbnation.com/nigelburchandthefleapitorchestra&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>With her foundations rooted in acoustic music, Abi&#8217;s songs are well crafted, accessible and full of warmth, reminiscent of the 60&#8217;s/ 70&#8217;s songwriters.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Farncombe Cavern is pleased to welcome back Abi Moore, who performed here last on the on the 17th of September 2010. With her foundations rooted in acoustic music, Abi&#8217;s songs are well crafted, accessible and full of warmth, reminiscent of the 60&#8217;s/ 70&#8217;s songwriters - Elton John, Sting, Lennon and McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Fleetwood Mac, Bob Dylan and Simon and Garfunkel. Add in Abi&#8217;s modern- day relevance, cynical grit, a glance to Kate Bush, Sheryl Crow and Karine Polwart and then lace it all up with thought provoking, observational, truthful and socially aware lyrics. If that doesn&#8217;t get you hooked, her astounding voice and luscious vocal harmonies certainly will. Staunchly independent, Abi&#8217;s music is made without compromise and without barriers. She self- released both of her albums, &#8220;The Aftermath of &#8216;96&#8221; in 2006 and her second album &#8220;Things We Should&#8217;ve Said&#8221; along with a live DVD in 2009. She completed a massive 70- date national tour as Artist of the Month for Caf&#233; Nero in the summer of 2009 and her albums were played in all 360 of their UK branches. 2010 saw the opening of her new record label &#8220;Honest Records&#8221; and she is currently working on her third album.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Daniel Benisty opens for brilliant jazz duet Charlotte and Ollie</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Benisty is an eclectic in the truest sense of the word, switching from Giuseppe Verdi to Kings of Leon to Ray Charles to Michael Buble in a matter of minutes. His favourite interpretations are currently close to Billie Holiday, Diana Krall and Nina Simone. Charlotte McKay and Ollie Metcalfe are outstanding young graduates from the London School of Musical Theatre. They will be performing a range of Ella Fitzgerald and Musical Theatre favourites from 830. Charlotte's singing is quite beautiful. Close your eyes and you will think Ella Fitzgerald or someone of her effortless talent, lyrical wizardry and sublime vocal control is in the room.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>At this year's Gail's Garden Party there will be a special presentation by young musicians from Tomorrow's Warriors, a leading UK organisation for jazz music education and professional artist development</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;This year will be the 6th year of running our annual food festival, The GAIL&#8217;s Garden Party, in Hampstead on September 10th. We'd like people to return to their high streets to shop at their local butchers, fishmongers, greengrocer and cheesemongers, which used to be the heart and soul of a community; a distinctive place where people come together to meet, shop and interact. The Garden Party is our way of bringing the community back together and saying &#8216;thank you&#8217; for welcoming us to Hampstead, our first shop, all those years ago. A number of stallholders will set up on Oriel Place to sell their beautiful food and we&#8217;ll have live music and facepainting. This year, we&#8217;re teaming up with the Gayton Festival, so you can buy your foodie treats at the Garden Party and head down to Gayton Road where there will be plenty of fun and games to keep the kids happy and burn off some energy.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Assembly are an amalgamation of two Liverpool bands from the early 2000&#8217;s. After separating and leaving their home city to go to university, each pursued other musical projects, until paths crossed again in London. Having played the London circuit for a while, they've built up a reputation of delivering high- energy shows, combining folk melodies with an indie-rock drive, and hammering out "hook-laden songs". With an increasing fan base, some great press reviews, and an unquenchable thirst for playing live, this band is "guaranteed to leave a lasting impression!" With Special Guest: Beggars Canyon Doors: 6:30 p.m. Tickets: &#163;8 on the door&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>One-off collaboration between two groundbreaking forces of lyrical Hip Hop (Lyrix Organix &amp; The Hip Hop Shakespeare Company).</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;One-off collaboration between two groundbreaking forces of lyrical Hip Hop (Lyrix Organix &amp; The Hip Hop Shakespeare Company) - headlined by Mercury-nominated TY, hosted by UK&#8217;s finest emcee AKALA - exploring parallels between Shakespeare and Hip Hop. Featuring special guests, DJ&#8217;s and stalls. With a huge show at Glastonbury Festival 2011 (at Bassline Circus) already causing a palpable buzz, Lyrix Organix returns to Rich Mix with a ground-breaking live experience rooted in Hip Hop and Spoken Word. Potent poetry, revolutionist Hip Hop, spine-tingling Folk and raw Soul collide in a palette of innovative live shows &#8211; packed with surprise collaborations, beat boxers, DJ&#8217;s, live visuals, urban art, fashion and charity (Medecins Sans Frontieres) coming together to conjure a unique and vibrant atmosphere. A reputation for diversity, cutting-edge talent and ethical ethos has seen Lyrix Organix rise to become one of the most talked-about promoters in the UK. Lyrix Organix works closely with and raise awareness for several important causes, including international humanitarian aid charity M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res (to whom we have donated all our profits to date). Pushing boundaries. Broadening minds. Raising consciousness. Lyrix Organix: www.lyrixorganix.com&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;It's that song you had in your head though you never heard it before It's those words that couldn't be said cos they needed a little bit more It's something new and though you haven't a clue you hum along all the while Cos you feel in tune with others in the room and it's starting to make you SMILE Smile is an acoustic night with free cake, free entry, a good bar and great original songs from real musicians who like to give a bit back on a Sunday evening off. It&#8217;s diverse, thoughtful, pleasant and fun, with new music from everyone. You might have seen the musicians before, on a big stage or rocking the floor, but Smile is where they come to chill out, to play songs that say what it&#8217;s all about. We keep the sets short to keep the music fresh, there&#8217;s always something coming up next. But they all get up and play a little more, and before you know it we&#8217;ll have to kick you out the door. Don&#8217;t worry you can come again, you&#8217;ll probably want to bring a friend&#8230; Arthur Lea arthurlea.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

In August 1994, Abdul Salam was invited to arrange three songs for Led Zeppelin, which he performed in a live concert on GMT. In 1995, he was involved in the composition of the soundtrack of the French Film 'Marie de Nazareth'. Later that year, Abdul Salam worked with the renowned flamenco guitarist Juan Martin and his group, a collaboration which culminated in the release of Musica Alhambra, a CD exploring Flamenco, Arab, Moorish, Indian gipsy and Sephardic music. This CD was performed live during several tours throughout England, Scotland, Ireland, Algeria, Oman and Turkey. In 2004, Abdul Salam took part in a Channel 5 Documentary about Andalusian music with the Spanish singer Clara Sanabras. In 2005, he joined the Ex-Cathedra Choir in Birmingham for a concert of Christian and Islamic music. Also in 2005, he was one of the soloists for the 'Big Voice Festival' in Birmingham, for which a choir 1000 singers came together. In the same year, he performed with the lute player David Miller in the Kilkenny International Festival in Ireland. With his 'Arabic Group', Abdul Salam performed in many festivals throughout the UK, including the Worcester Festival and the English Heritage Festival in Cheswick. In 2006, Abdul Salam performed for His Highness Prince Charles and Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia in the Llangollen Festival in Wales. Later that year, he released the album 'Convivencia' with the famous soprano Catherine Bott, lute player David Miller and percussionist Stephen Henderson. As a performer and teacher of Arab singing and oud, Abdul Salam has a longstanding association with Dartington International Summer School.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Man Man is joining us from Philadelphia. They're over in Europe for a few weeks and making a two-date foray into the UK. It got sold to me like this: "Finally the wild and exciting MAN MAN will come back to Europe with a new album on ANTI Their new record "Life Fantastic" is recorded by Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, Monsters of Folk) First review (uncut) attached. No more explanation needed I think..." He was right - they're one of the best bands I've ever seen live.

  <short_description>A night with americana, cajun, gypsy folk style live music</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Every Monday again we invite you to our amazing Red Sky At Night Host Dakota Jim &amp; his Family with a night of americana, cajun, gypsy folk style live music Bands such as 'Dakota Jim &amp; his Family, Louisa Jones, Garance Louis our french chanson musette, Brook Sharkey, Franky &amp; the Jacks, TJ Johnson and 'The General play regulary on this night. And always with a spectacular guest band. This weeks special guest band Le Skeleton Band Le Skeleton Band is a great sonic for the sad Pere Lachaise soul. Let us pass Chopin, Wilde &amp; Morrison &amp; spy on slow night skeletons scattering amongst the tombs. It truly works, I&#8217;d contentedly dance mad &amp; liberated beneath casting momentary silhouettes within the sphere of LSB. Their debut album &#8216;Preacher Blues&#8217; is complete, well structured and consistent in its message. It is sad but at the same time encouraging. They seem like a younger sibling of their compatriots Noir Desir but hopefully the follicley challenged lead singer will not bludgeon his girlfriend to death with a pottery penis &#8211; then again perhaps this passion is why Noir Desir have the beards &amp; LSB the butt fluff. www.myspace.com/alexandtheskeletonband 8- 11pm Only &#163;3&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>A night with americana, cajun, gypsy folk style live music</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Every Monday again we invite you to our amazing Red Sky At Night Host Dakota Jim &amp; his Family with a night of americana, cajun, gypsy folk style live music Bands such as 'Dakota Jim &amp; his Family, Louisa Jones, Garance Louis our french chanson musette, Brook Sharkey, Franky &amp; the Jacks, TJ Johnson and 'The General play regulary on this night. And always with a spectacular guest band. This weeks special guest band Le Skeleton Band Le Skeleton Band is a great sonic for the sad Pere Lachaise soul. Let us pass Chopin, Wilde &amp; Morrison &amp; spy on slow night skeletons scattering amongst the tombs. It truly works, I&#8217;d contentedly dance mad &amp; liberated beneath casting momentary silhouettes within the sphere of LSB. Their debut album &#8216;Preacher Blues&#8217; is complete, well structured and consistent in its message. It is sad but at the same time encouraging. They seem like a younger sibling of their compatriots Noir Desir but hopefully the follicley challenged lead singer will not bludgeon his girlfriend to death with a pottery penis &#8211; then again perhaps this passion is why Noir Desir have the beards &amp; LSB the butt fluff. www.myspace.com/alexandtheskeletonband 8- 11pm Only &#163;3&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Substance and Goo Music present a free night of Indie </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Substance and Goo Music present a free night of Indie General Bye Bye - 10.15pm &#8220;Still, the songs take on a particular lilt, the phrasing and syntax unusual enough to set tracks like &#8220;Alphabet&#8221; (&#8221;I give you L for Lullaby, I give you O for Oh my my, I give you V for Vanity, I give you E for you and me&#8221;) apart from the current deluge of indie-pop offerings. The simple sweetness of General Bye Bye&#8217;s songs are also a clue to the band&#8217;s accessibility, and what has inspired fans to fund the U.S. tour.&#8221; &#8212; Alli Marschall, MOUNTAIN X-PRESS Young Aviators 9.15pm Alternative / New Wave / Surf Megafauna - 8.15pm "The group has it all, wrapped in a small three-person-package, and it's weird and haunting and erratic and inspiring and wonky and frightening and wonderful all at once." &#8212; Cannibal Cheerleader "Neff&#8217;s fragile vocals may set you in a trance, but she&#8217;ll quickly jolt you back to life with the snap of her axe." &#8212; The Austinist "Remember the shock of seeing Jucifer for the first time? The adrenaline jolt of seeing lead singer Amber Valentine shred her guitar in a one-million-notes-a-second blast of power? If that experience is worth reliving, be sure to check out Austin&#8217;s Megafauna." &#8212; Flagpole Magazine "Neff pulls off several of the moves that eventually required Eddie Van Halen to undergo hand surgery. Will Krause and Cameron Page&#8217;s brimstone rhythm heed to solos that will melt the seals off seven scrolls." &#8212; San Antonio Current "Their songs are confident enough to take long detours through quiet sections before exploding in blood-curdling, burning-flesh guitar solos... One of the most original bands in Austin." &#8212; Big Western Flavor "Led by the smooth vocals and jagged edge of guitarist Dani Neff, their &#8220;Fun at the Apocalypse&#8221; and &#8220;Machines in the Sky&#8221; ride the wild rails of early 1990s Austin punk." &#8212; Austin Chronicle "Epic yet fiercely catchy." &#8212; The Deli Magazine More details at http://www.substancegigs.com/showdetails.php?sid=87&amp;vid=&amp;pa=3 Plus late DJ's A Substance venue, this newly opened intimate venue in the heart of London is 260 person capacity spread over 2 floors. The upstairs bar (110 capacity) combines a Bohemian look and style inspired by New York beat poets such as Jack Kerouac, is ideal for drinks before and after a show or after a hard day at work. While the basement venue (150 capacity) hosts some of London&#8217;s finest live music, comedy and club nights 7 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;On their debut, the life-affirming Wagonwheel Blues, and the follow-up EP, Future Weather, Philly&#8217;s The War on Drugs seemed obsessed with disparate ideas, with building uncompromised rock monuments from pieces that may have seemed like odd pairs. Folk-rock marathons come damaged by drum machines. Electronic and instrumental reprises precede songs they&#8217;ve yet to play, and Dr. Seuss becomes lyrical motivation for bold futuristic visions. Now, Granduciel has done it again, better than before: Slave Ambient (Out Aug. 16), their proper second album, is a brilliant 47-minute sprawl of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll, conceptualized with a sense of adventure and captured with seasons of bravado.

  <short_description>Tonights live performance is special because it is also the night Alex launches his debut album 'Serpent'. Alex is one of the UK's most in demand session players and has played with the likes of Jools Holland, Van Morrison and Paul Weller.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most talented saxophonists in Britain, Alex Garnett is perhaps best known on the jazz scene for his superb work with Ray Gelato&#8217;s Giants, but can equally well be found in settings that range from Jools Holland to Van Morrison. The list of international stars Alex has worked with covers the fields of the best of blues and popular music, with Paul Weller, Johnny &#8216;Guitar&#8217; Watson and Albert King a fair sample. Tonight he launches his debut album, &#8216;Serpent&#8217; http://bit.ly/p9Gh6R&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Following their multi-million selling anthem, House of the Rising Sun, The Animals acheived over twenty top ten records, many reaching Number One.  After over forty years the legend still grows and the raw energy continues to burn in their souls.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Legendary musicians unite. Original Animals join ultimate forces with John Steel and Mick Gallagher (The Blockhead, The Clash, Paul McCartney), John E. Williamson (Titanic), Peter Barton (Wayne Fontana's Mindbenders, Boomtown Rats) and Steve Cropper of Booker T and the MGs. As Co-writer of (Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay, Knock on Wood and In the Midnight Hour, Cropper's work is immortal. Ranked second only to Jimi Hendrix by Mojo Magazine as the number two guitarist of all time, his much anticipated new solo album features guest performers Lucinda Williams and Keb Mo.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Stan Sulzmann is without question one of the most highly respected musicians in the UK today, admired by musicians and audiences for his instantly recognisable sound, and boundless creative imagination, and is a source of inspiration to many of Britain's emerging young musicians. His career stretches back to the 60&#8217;s when, as part of a uniquely talented crop of British musicians, he played with Graham Collier, John Taylor, Kenny Wheeler and Gordon Beck, as well as leading many groups of his own. His forty years in the business have seen him work with Gil Evans, Mike Gibbs, the New York Composers&#8217; Orchestra, Michael Brecker and the NDR Big Band (alongside Chet Baker). Further musical partnerships have developed with British pianist Nikki Iles, American keyboard player Marc Copland and the trio Ordesa &#8211; a drumless, bassless combination with Kenny Wheeler and John Parricelli. A prolific and widely respected composer, his music can be heard in small and large ensemble settings alike, having written for the London Trombone Quartet, the London Jazz Orchestra, the Guildhall School of Music Jazz Orchestra and The European Jazz Ensemble. &#8220;An accomplished and distinguished composer&#8230;his music has been described in glowing terms 'ravishing, delicious, powerful and direct&#8230;meticulously written, sometimes echoing the imaginative and much missed orchestra of Michael Gibbs&#8221; The Guardian Joining Stan at the Cavern will be the trio of Marianne Windham (bass), John Elliott (keyboard) and Tom Fyfe (drums).&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Jazz in London with Antonio Forcione at Pizza Express.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Join Antonio Forcione + special guests for a sneak preview of his new album &#8216;Sketches of Africa&#8217;. Inspired by recent travels to the Continent this is Antonio&#8217;s first new recording in five years. A beautifully captured concoction of world music with an emphasis on what African music does best: rhythm and melody. Antonio Forcione is a master of his game, not only as one of the great acoustic guitarists but globally respected for his compositions. This new album buzzes with originality, craftsmanship and passion. This is an album low on instrumental self-indulgence and packed with stunning melodies and toe-tapping beats such as the evocative Madiba's Jive, composed as a tribute to Mandela.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Lily Neill presents an original musical blend of classical, jazz and folk traditions along with her own compositions for a performance that is truly unique.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Lily Neill - harp Doors open at 7pm, music begins at 7:30pm Loyalty Card Holdlers - this concert applies to our loyalty card scheme Lily Neill has performed around the world in cities as diverse as Dublin, Helsinki, Kazan, London, Moscow, New York City, Paris, Saint Petersburg, Vilnius and Washington, D.C. She has had the honour of performing for the former U.S. President Bill Clinton and for Ireland&#8217;s President Mary McAleese. Lily&#8217;s repertoire is a combination of original compositions and music from folk traditions and her appearances, from performances in concert halls and arts centres to shows at clubs and festivals, have allowed her to bring the harp to new audiences. In addition to her solo work, Lily has performed and recorded with rock, pop and folk groups including the Irish super group &#8220;The Chieftains&#8221; alongside the legendary Derek Bell. Critics have praised Lily&#8217;s superb technique as well as her musical versatility and the uniqueness of her musical style. Celtic Beat has written of Lily, &#8220;If ever a harper made a harp dance it is Lily Neill&#8221; and Irish Music Magazine called her work &#8220;...part of the new Harp revolution extolling aspects of harp music never previously heard&#8221;. Lily&#8217;s original compositions reflect her travels around the world. Her knowledge of the music of Ireland, the Nordic countries and beyond has helped to shape her universal sound. Lily has released two solo CDs, &#8220;Without Words&#8221; and &#8220;The Habit of a Foreign Sky&#8221; to strong acclaim. In a review of &#8220;The Habit of a Foreign Sky&#8221;, the Irish American News calls Lily one of the top harpers today and Irish Music Magazine writes, &#8220;The Habit of a Foreign Sky lives and breathes with a musical and artistic freedom which is boundless in its possibility and contagious in its energy and passion&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Afterglow Electric builds on the unprecedented success of its acoustic sibling. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Afterglow Electric builds on the unprecedented success of its acoustic sibling. While Afterglow gave you the pleasures of an intimate and close up gig, Afterglow Electric will blow you away with full on never before heard sets from Ash King, Aggi Dukes, Flux and a very special guest. Killa Kela vs Ami Carmine (The Dual Project) Having toured all over the world Killa Kela is the most recognised and respected beatboxer in the industry. Killa Kela has released 3 full-length albums exploring genres far beyond beatbox and his talent has seen him tour the world and perform alongside the likes of Prince, Pharrell and N*E*R*D, Justin Timberlake, Super Furry Animals, De La Soul and Plan B. Killa Kela has now created a new live performance entitled The Dual Project which sees him spitting lyrics and battling it out with live DJ and vocalist, Ami Carmine (formally known as Ami Drum, lead vocalist for Bassment Jaxx). The mix of beatboxing and live vocals teamed with massive tunes from an array of genres excites audiences creating a combination that has something for everyone to enjoy. Flux With a well-earned reputation for making music that is intricate, beautiful and genre-defying, Flux are becoming one of London&#8217;s most exciting bands. Made of 6 members who all have flourishing individual careers, Flux are a band of cutting-edge quality. After a great year of performances at Glastonbury, Southbank Centre, The Great Escape and Indigo 02, Flux return to Rich Mix with their newest and unheard music. Aggi Dukes Aggi Dukes is quickly establishing himself as the hardest working genre-free songwriter, rapper and producer around. With performances at multiple festivals over the last two years including Secret Garden Party, Hip hop Kemp (Czech Republic) and Glastonbury 2011 and with collaborations alongside Chicane, Frankmusik, Killa Kela, Wiley, Westfunk, Chase and Status, and composer Shammi Pithia, Dukes comes back to Rich Mix to perform tracks off his debut album LEGACY which will be released late 2011. Ash King Ash King is one of the few singers that has enjoyed commercial success in the Indian film industry, middle Eastern and south Asian charts around the world. He most recently hit number 1 on Asian radio stations with the film song Te Amo and has sung major songs for musical giants A R Rahman and Prtiam as well as appearing on an official remix of Lady Gaga&#8217;s Just Dance. Tonight, with the support of his band, Ash King will be singing songs from the debut album he is currently recording.

  <short_description>East London is set to become a destination in its own right as a result of the Olympics, and the launch of Scipmylo brings a compelling reason for people to visit this fantastic, undiscovered corner of London long after the athletes have left. </short_description>

So there you have it - 14 songs in a fast paced and varied show plus a little help from a young chap called George. Josie and Steve would love you to be there - it's one Thursday evening you will never forget. Go to www.scipmylo.co.uk or www.ticketweb.co.uk/scipmylo/ for tickets.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

&#171; Iness Mezel's French and north African fusion blues makes for an impressive set &#187;</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;INESS MEZEL is a perfect modern fusion artist. French-Italian mother, Berber-Kabyle father she was raised in Both France and Algeria. From this wonderful cultural mix emerged a sharp musical mind coupled with a passionate vocal style. Her new Justin Adams produced record &#171; Beyond the Trance &#187; (Wrasse Records) is a fearlessly modern blend of North African Berber, soul, funk and R&amp;B. Mark Hudson of the Telegraph referred to it as &#171; a master class in visceral post-folk &#187;. Tonight Iness Mezel and her band bring their North African and French fusion blues to London for her only UK show in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>London bands Halfway To New York and Healer/Monster launch their new singles with a co-headline show at Cargo.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Halfway To New York are quickly gaining notoriety on the indie music scene with their original mix of contemporary guitar driven rock, reminiscent of The Doves and Snow Patrol &#8211; with a slash of Stereophonics for good measure. Healer/Monster are three men unleashing their own musical Jekyll and Hyde onto the world. They are, to a man, the thinking person&#8217;s dumb ass rock and roll satyrs for the new nuclear age. The overall mood is reminiscent of the Pixies or a ballsier Pavement. Like all good bands though Healer/Monster cement their own style. The more one listens, the more reference points evaporate with such a prominent funk and psychedelic sound.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The founder of British Nu-Soul plays a rare gig at Hideaway, SW16. It's his only gig in the capital in September and he'll be playing hits from the 90s. The gig is to celebrate the re-release of album Sing (If You Want It) and new single Dancing.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Omar, the founder of nu-classic British soul, brings his vocal talents to the same stage as this hard-swinging quartet, whose last album featured a superb, soulful rendition of Stevie Wonder&#8217;s &#8216;Smile Please&#8217;. Hugely respected by fellow musicians around the world with Stevie Wonder proclaiming himself a fan, Omar has worked with the likes of Estelle, Common and, of course, Motown superstar Stevie Wonder himself! Together with Quentin Collins and Brandon Allen Quartet this promises to be an unmissable night. http://bit.ly/qyepra&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>After a sold out farewell tour at the O2 Empire The Bluetones venture to Ginglik for the aftershow party featuring live acts, DJ&#8217;s &amp; a rare DJ set from frontman Mark Morris. This is a chance to say goodbye in an unusually intimate setting.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;After their sold out, farewell tour at Shepherds Bush Empire The Bluetones boys venture across the road to party at Ginglik. After 17 years of touring and 6 studio albums, they are the band responsible for music that defined the Brit Pop era. Their debut album impressively shot straight to number one &#8211; back in the days when that meant people, other than just family and friends, had bought it! The Bluetones legacy has almost spanned two decades and they have now decided it&#8217;s time to say goodbye. In the autumn the guys will tour the UK playing their last ever gigs, expecting and hoping to go out with a bang! The aftershow will feature live acts, DJ&#8217;s and a rare DJ performance from their frontman Mark Morris. This is a chance to rub shoulders with the guys, see them off, and say good bye in an unusually intimate setting. The Bluetones frontman Mark Morriss DJ set Mark will be playing a Britpop to modern day Indie set giving you guys a slight return to 90&#8242;s. Final Few An Indie/Blues outfit with an all out 70&#8242;s rock vibe. Destined for big things, fresh back from a recent support with Basement Jaxx. The Harlots A fresh new indie band with Beatle esque melodies and lots of energy. Honey Dog Acoustic tunes with gravelly vocals, backed by side guitar and interesting extras.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;AFRI-KOKOA presents FOKN Bois (Wanlov,M3nsa and DJ Edu (1 Xtra). When it comes to the Pidgen Music Super Duo known as the FOKN Bois, the two &#8220;h&#8221;s in Hiphop stand for &#8220;Humour&#8221; and &#8220;Hilarious&#8221;. One half is Wanlov the Kubolor; the other half is M3NSA the Magnificent. Both recently MOBO nominated for &#8220;Best African Act&#8221;, the FOKN Bois are credited for creating the first Pidgen Musical film in the world dubbed &#8220;Coz Ov Moni&#8221; which has premiered to high patronage in Ghana the UK and the USA. The film itself premiered in the UK and the US, has been accepted at the Rio International Film Festival (Brazil), and at the Pan African Film Festivals in Los Angeles and Cannes. It was screened at the Black August Festival in New York, where M3NSA blessed the stage with Hip-hop icons Dead Prez and Talib Kweli. They are being compared to duos like Outkast, Redman &amp; Method Man, Kid N Play and Aki &amp; Porpor or Laurel &amp; Hardy, but their fans know to expect anything from this insane super duo who balance lyrical skills with satire and sarcasm. Their style of Hiphop is raw, braggadocios, witty and eccentric. The FOKN Bois are currently working on their next album &#8220;FOKN Wit Ewe&#8221; which they claim they are making as politically incorrect as possible to lose all their fans and replace them with air conditioners. This is not an African thing...just do the FOKN thing! DJs: AJ Kwame (Afri-kokoa), Volta 45 (Afrospot) &amp; Chief Commander Yaaba Playing a super funky selection of afrobeat, highlife, hiplife, afro-mashups&#8230;..

  <short_description>Daniel Benisty opens for the wildly talented lyrically gifted singer-songwriter that is Kristina Lao. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Benisty, resident pianist, host and musical director at Caffe Concerto, takes great pleasure to introduce some of London's brightest new song-writing and performing talent. Kristina Lao has been seeping into the veins of London&#8217;s live music scene since leaving her hometown of Hong Kong, where she launched her EP &#8216;Into the Woods with a Cardboard Box&#8217;. Her catchy, folk-pop infusions are inspired by the likes of Johnny Cash, Regina Spektor and the Moldy Peaches, culminating in mellifluous, moody melodies, quirky lyrics and sufficiently splendiferous storytelling. She will be playing with the wonderful Angelo Mateus (guitar) and Oliver Metcalfe (violin) at Caffe Concerto on the 16th of September, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>WHITE WIZZARD &amp; JETTBLACK

White Wizzard hails from Los Angeles CA, formed to bring the songwriting, melody and good times back into metal and rock.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;White Wizzard hails from Los Angeles CA. Tired of the same old down-tuned metal that seems to be everywhere these days, Jon Leon formed White Wizzard in the summer of 2007. The goal was simple &#8211; to bring the songwriting, melody and good times back into metal and rock. A 7 song EP was recorded in the fall of 2007 with the first line up and was well received and is about to be released worldwide. White Wizzard then released in early 2010 the album &#8216;Over the top&#8217; with a changed line up.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

He has appeared live and on TV with with many top performers including David Sanborn, Mavis Staples, Eric Clapton, Paul Carrack, Lulu, Tom Jones, Jamie Cullum, Will Young, Ruby Turner and Sam Brown. &#8220;Sax Appeal astounded me with their power and strong soloists; the band could be one of the biggest jazz/funk bands this country has ever produced.&#8221; Jazz News http://bit.ly/nK4ztd&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Gary Mullen &amp; The Works Perform One Night Of Queen</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday 17 September 7.30pm In 2000, Gary Mullen won ITV&#8217;s &#8220;Stars In Their Eyes&#8221; Live Grand Final, with the largest number of votes ever received in the shows history. The record of 864,838 votes was more than twice that of the runner-up. Gary began touring on his own, and in 2002, formed a band, The Works, to pay tribute to the rock legends that are Queen. Since May 2002 Gary Mullen and The Works have performed in the UK, USA, Europe, South Africa and New Zealand to sell-out audiences. They have also twice rocked the prestigious BBC Proms in the Park, in front of a very enthusiastic crowd of 40,000. Gary Mullen and The Works perform One Night of Queen, a spectacular live concert, recreating the look, sound, pomp and showmanship of arguably the greatest rock band of all time. This show will ROCK you! http://www.garymullenandtheworks.com/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Mim's roots go back to the UK Folk Scene of the '70s when she was likened to Joan Baez, and ranked alongside Maddy Prior and other revivalists of the time before she emigrated to South Africa. Then, she played a significant role in the folk revival, appearing at most of the Folk Clubs and Festivals of the time, including Edinburgh and Cambridge, with acclaim from all the leading critics of the day. Miriam's interpretation of traditional and modern folk songs are unique, and her ability to lead a Folk audience into chorus singing, particularly, 'Keys of Canterbury' at Cambridge Folk Festival 1976, is the stuff of legends.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;This multi-cultural Brixton-born band&#8217;s live shows have made them one of the must-see bands on the African Underground music circuit. Their fusion of Hi-Life &amp; Afro-Funk is driven by fat analogue basslines, blazing horns and a mixture of sparkling African and gritty rock guitars. Punky Afro-roots music for the 21st Century. Upstairs at the Ritzy is the lovely bar and exciting venue above the Ritzy Cinema. We're open 7 nights a week and we pride ourselves on being a well-known &amp; well-loved cultural hub for Brixton. Our stage show-cases a consistently high standard of live music, from Reggae, Afro-beat &amp; Vintage-Swing, to World-Jazz, Folk, Blues, Balkan &amp; beyond! Plus we bring a monthly comedy feast, open mic, performance, workshops &amp; all sorts of exciting group activities. Full menu served all day till 8.30pm &#8211; so there&#8217;s eats to be had too!

</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Art Film, Music &amp; Spoken Word from the Diaspora NUMBI live shows are a series of cross-cultural events from the Diaspora. The programme aims to bring a visible African Diaspora especially Somali cultural presence into London's landscape through collaborations and cultural dialogue. NUMBI will include music, spoken word, dance, visual arts and electronic media (Film) (this event will be the main Launch of 'Scarf' kudu arts cross cultural magazine) elements. NUMBI is influenced and inspired by traditional and contemporary Somali culture as well as the fusion of forms created by artists from the Somali diaspora and those collaborating with them. Much of the work will rely less on language, aiming to make NUMBI accessible to diverse participants and audiences. The elements of Somali and English spoken word will be based on common linguistic experiences of the Somali diaspora and we are very proud to have been working this year in partnership with the poetry translation centre who have translated the work of two very talented Somali poets to English and their work will be performed for the first time at this event. The principal artists include Faysal Aw-Cabdi and Caasha-Luul Maxamuud and many more. Music: DJ Nikki Lucas, DJ Oli Numbi music Jam featuring guests Macallow, The Seeds of Creation, Frends of Designe, Siemy Di Sestem. Mixed media, performance, visual artists: Max Boufathal, Nathalie Mba Bikoro, Kinsi Abdulleh. Kudu Arts kuduarts.org&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Cuban Funk and merged with London flavours from London's new Latin revolutionaries Wara. Slammin new electric high life, rumba and soukous from AJ Holmes and the Hackney Empire and Afro-dub influenced party Hip Hop from Fur. Plus DJ Cal Jader drops the freshest Latin beats and Tropical bass rhythms. Having played a packed summer season of festival shows and always jumping high profile London gigs Wara showcase material from their new EP on Movimientos Records which introduces the band with four tracks, musically merging Cuban Funk, Cumbia and Afro-Latin beats with Hip Hop, Jazz, Soul and even Dubstep and Drum and Bass. Wara have created a musical genre of their own with strong Cuban roots, taking influences from Timba (like Salsa but musically and lyrically stronger) and new bands feeding in fun and Afro Cuban styles... A true melting pot of identities, the band members live in London with backgrounds from all over the world, from Cuba, Argentina, Venezuela and Chile to Ghana, Congo, Spain and the UK. Fur play all live post-dilla conscious hip-hop with beats and instrumentals inspired and riding the west-african, west-jamaican and a bit of east (and west) london frequencies. And from the depths of Hackney come a band that are taking over the world with the unique Afro-pop sound of The New Electric High Life. They are A.J. Holmes &amp; The Hackney Empire. This five-piece are destroying everywhere they play, the ultimate Afro party disco machine. http://www.movimientos.org.uk/ http://www.hootanannybrixton.co.uk/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

with a Classic Sound System Set with TRANSGLOBAL UNDERGROUND. The 4th CD release from Whirl-Y-Music.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Whirl-y-Gig embodies the spirit of community in a carnival atmosphere. Bathed in rainbow rippling lights and wrapped in exotic d&#233;cor, it is a festival of delights for people of all ages and places. Dance to the Whirl-y-Beat and journey through Whirl-y-Gig's unique electronic landscape, where many diverse elements blend into one cohesive and unifying experience. From heavy dub and funky drum'n'bass to tropical house and uplifting tribal trance, the Whirl-y-Mix embraces flavours of global and celtic, classical and psychedelic, rock and even pop, roots and radical. Whether it be African or European, Arabic or Asian, Whirl-y-Gig finds inspiration from around the world, yet is rooted firmly in the here and now of London's alternative club scene. Whirl-y-Gig is an event difficult to describe and a moment difficult to miss. With a strong and loving life force, the Whirl-y-Sound is a musical heartbeat for a future global family.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Memphis May Fire + The Color Morale + Dream Dreamer + Collapse The Control

Memphis May Fire is a southern rock/post-hardcore band from Dallas, Texas, United States.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Memphis May Fire is a southern rock/post-hardcore band from Dallas, Texas, United States. The band formed in December 2006 as &#8216;O Captain, My Captain!&#8217; In February of 2007, the band changed its name to Memphis May Fire. They soon recorded and self-released an EP, which caught the attention of Josh Grabelle, president of Trustkill Records, who commented that the EP was the most compelling EP he had heard since Welsh heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine&#8217;s Hand of Blood. They were quickly signed to Trustkill who re-released their self-titled EP in December 2007. Though the band wanted their first studio album by summer of 2008, they soon had to postpone it due to the departure of their vocalist Chase Ryan, who left to care for his newborn child. Soon after, bassist Austin Radford too left the band. He was quickly replaced by Cory Elder and they began to record the instruments with producer Casey Bates. Matty Mullins was soon chosen as the new vocalist and was rushed to the studio to finish tracking vocals for their new album Sleepwallking. The album was released July 21, 2009 under Trustkill Records. The song &#8220;Ghost In the Mirror&#8221; was featured in the soundtrack for the movie Saw VI. Soon after, drummer Jeremy Grisham left the band and was replaced by Eric Molesworth. After the release of Sleepwalking, the band signed to Bullet Tooth Records and released their second EP Between the Lies on November 2, 2010. Their song &#8220;Action/Adventure&#8221; was featured in the video game Rock Band 3. Drummer Eric Molesworth then left the band and was replaced by Jake Garland. On January 17th, 2011, Rise Records announced that Memphis May Fire had signed to the label and was releasing an album in the spring. The album was recorded at Chango studios in Orlando, Florida, United States. Their second studio album, The Hollow was released on April 26th, 2011, on Rise Records.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Three musicians who, besides the fact that they&#8217;re all three extremely talented virtuosi, have two other things in common: they are exceptionaly versatile and they count more musicians than non-musicians amongst their fans. For decades they have been too busy performing as sidemen with countless big names in studios as well as on all the biggest stages worldwide. Reggie Washington&#8217;s previous track record should speak for itself with over more than twenty years recording, collaborating and/or touring with Cassandra Wilson, Don Byron, Oliver Lake, Me&#8217;shell N'degeOcello, Ronnie Cuber, Lester Bowie, World Saxophone Quartet, Mike Mainieri &amp; Steps Ahead, Will Smith, M-Base Collective, Ute Lemper, Jean-Paul Bourelly, Uri Caine and Cheick-Tidiane Seck plus performing at almost every jazz and music festival worldwide with artists such as Roy Hargrove, Branford Marsalis, Steve Coleman and Chico Hamilton just to name a few. Reggie was also a participant in Bass Day '97 in NYC with Oteil Burbridge, John Patitucci, Billy Sheehan &amp; Tony Levin. Over the last 5 years, Reggie has eventually found enough time to expand his horizons as a leader. His debut CD "A Lot of Love, LIVE!" (Jammin&#8217;colorS) is comprised of two live trio concerts with saxophonist Ravi Coltrane and drummer Gene Lake and Belgian musicians saxophonist Erwin Vann and drummer St&#233;phane Galland. The CD has received very positive reviews internationally and accolades from journalists &amp; colleagues worldwide in the music business. Jef Lee Johnson, claiming early influences as diverse as Herb Alpert, Eric Dolphy and Vanilla Fudge, is well-known as a session musician, playing for everyone from pop stars like Aretha Franklin and Billy Joel, to smooth jazz vocalists like Phyllis Hyman and Rachelle Ferrell, from pianist legend George Duke to fearless experimentalists like Ronald Shannon Jackson and McCoy Tyner. His solo albums, ranging from 1996's &#171; Blue &#187; to, more recently, &#171; Longing Belonging Ongoing &#187; (with his Aka Rainbow Crow project) are equally wide-ranging affairs, veering from straightforward pop songs to guitar-noise experiments that recall both Sonny Sharrock and Sonic Youth. Gene Lake, who is mostly heard as a jazz and funk drummer, has been playing for more than two decades with a stunningly diverse range of artists: from r&amp;b group Surface in the 1980s to the &#8220;new wave&#8221; of r&amp;b acts such as Me&#8217;shell NdegeOcello, Maxwell, and D&#8217;Angelo in the 1990s; from jazz innovators Steve Coleman and Henry Threadgill, to fusion legends Joe Zawinul and Marcus Miller; from jazz/rap group Opus Akoben to acts that are impossible to label, such as Dave Fiuczynski&#8217;s wildly original rock/funk/jazz fusion group Screaming Headless Torsos. Put these three musicians together and one can only guess what kind of music will result from this, but one thing&#8217;s for sure : their sonic trip will blow away every single member of the audience &#8211;musicians as well as non-musicians-, in an unforgettable way&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Reclaiming our food system An evening exploring the idea of food sovereignty through short films, speakers and discussion, followed by DJ set by Asian Dub Foundation&#8217;s John Pandit. While 1 billion people go hungry, hundreds of thousands suffer obesity and food producers in rich and poor countries alike struggle to make a living. The global food system is dysfunctional &#8211; but there are solutions. Our evening will explore the idea of food sovereignty, a way of putting both people and the planet first, and challenging the corporate dominance that makes our food system so unsustainable. We&#8217;ll have four short films, interspersed with expert speakers and discussion. Then Asian Dub Foundation&#8217;s John Pandit will kick up some tunes while you dance, chat or find out about our latest global justice campaigns. 6 Billion Ways www.6billionways.org.uk Facebook: www.facebook.com/6billionways Twitter: @6billionways&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Buddy Mondlock writes songs. He does it so well that some great songwriters have recorded them on their own albums; Guy Clark, Nanci Griffith and Janis Ian, to name a few. But there&#8217;s nothing quite like hearing the writer sing them. His third album, Poetic Justice, brought him to wider attention in the UK; Bob Harris began playing the album and he toured here for the first time. More recently he&#8217;s collaborated with the legendary Art Garfunkel, together with Maia Sharp, writing and recording the album Everything Waits to Be Noticed and touring all over America and Europe. Buddy&#8217;s out touring solo again, showcasing the songs as only he can. Look forward to a new album in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Peter Downes, an incredible talent and one of Europe's leading jazz fusion guitarists teams up with Dick Pearce on trumpet, a musician who plays with a sophiticated command of harmonic improvising. This promises to be a night full of British talent.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Peter Downes is one of those incredible talents that only surfaces once in a blue moon. Completely self taught, he is rapidly becoming one of Europe&#8217;s leading guitarists in the modern jazz fusion genre. Already established on the jazz scene in the UK and Italy with a string of regular appearances culminating with a packed audience at Glastonbury Festival where they played the Jazz Lounge. Dick Pearce - A player with an equally formidable reputation completes the line-up. Pearce was notable for being the kind of straight ahead player who might well have appeared on the London jazz scene twenty years earlier. He has a sophisticated command of harmonic improvising, although, as with his self-confessed (and disparate) trumpet heroes - Chet Baker, Art Farmer and Don Cherry - his playing comes across as anything but contrived. http://bit.ly/q31g1b&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>KEY is the hot new collaboration between keyboardists Bill Mudge and Brian Charette. Both are accomplished Hammond Organists who also embrace the colour of electronics.
</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;New York based Brian has recorded four albums as a leader for SteepleChase Records and performed with top artists like Joni Mitchell, Chaka Khan, and Lou Donaldson. Bill plays with with many London groups, including the Paul Jordanous Quintet, Mick Hanson's 'Organic Matters', and has performed recently at Ronnie Scott's with the Nigel Price Trio. His new album, 'Skylight' provides the framework for the group; funky organ groves with interesting electronic textures infused with exotic harmony from the middle east and contemporary classical music. Bill holds down the groove with the organ and bass pedals while Brian floats on top with an array of keyboards and effects - then they switch. Rounding out this keyboard power trio is one of the most in-demand drummers on the London jazz scene, Chris Nickolls. Chris leads his own critically acclaimed group 'The J Word' and plays regularly with many top London jazz acts.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Through his band, Warrior Soul, the Detroit native concocted his own Stooges / MC5-style blend of political activism and art rock tendencies, gave it a &#8217;90s spin, and tried to impart it upon Generation X (the kids, not the band)</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Kory Clarke wanted to be the Iggy Pop of the &#8217;90s. Through his band, Warrior Soul, the Detroit native concocted his own Stooges / MC5-style blend of political activism and art rock tendencies, gave it a &#8217;90s spin, and tried to impart it upon Generation X (the kids, not the band), but they never listened. Their first album, 1990&#8242;s Last Decade, Dead Century, was a critical sensation, especially in the U.K., who readily embraced the band&#8217;s political invective and insurrectionist rantings as the next big thing. But while Clarke certainly had the potential to become Gen X&#8217;s leading mainstream-bashing poet, the metallic hard rock sound he chose as his vehicle ultimately lost out to Nirvana&#8217;s nihilistic post-punk/alternative style. 1991&#8242;s Drugs, God, and the New Republic took their anarchist leanings even further, but not even a nationwide stadium tour supporting Queensryche could help further their cause. Forgoing their overt political message, the band decided to charge forth with thunderous punk rock energy on their stellar 3rd album 1992&#8217;s Salutations From the Ghetto Nation. Geffen refused get behind the band, claiming that punk rock didn&#8217;t sell, Clarke was livid and months later stormed into the label&#8217;s offices with a copy of Rolling Stone magazine, the cover story feature Green Day and proclaiming the return of punk rock. Eventually, Clarke resorted to an all-out war, telling all who would listen that the release of 1993&#8242;s artistically striking Chill Pill had been purposely botched by Geffen in order to merely fulfill their contractual obligation, after which the band was promptly dropped by the label. Clarke then sought to reinvent Warrior Soul as self-appointed cyberpunks for their fifth album, 1995&#8242;s Space Age Playboys, released on the independent Futurist label before disbanding Warrior Soul later that year. This time around, there are no hidden meanings or agendas in the lyrics, they tell it how it is and call a spade a fucking shovel with equal parts of brutality and precision. Kory&#8217;s ever present gravely vocals makes the band unique and immediately identifiable. "Destroy The War Machine" is Warrior Soul&#8217;s first studio album in 14 years.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;A night of pyche and nu-gaze bands featuring London's brightest new stars of the scene Lola Colt plus Horse Brothers who feature the former drummer from Adam &amp; The Ants and Bow Wow Wow. Lola Colt somehow marry the best bits of louche Americana with shoegazing and deliver a sonic punch that is menacing and oozing with cool, imbued with the sounds of Link Wray and the Velvet Underground and Ennio Morricone. A tantalising cacophony of unfettered sexual energy.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Laura Cole's contemporary jazz/folk sextet make their debut at The Forge</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Doors open 7:30pm, music begins at 8pm Loyalty Card Holders - this concert does apply to our loyalty card scheme Metamorphic are a contemporary jazz/folk sextet based in London. Their debut album, The Rock Between, was released on the F-ire label in April 2011. The instrumentalists in the group all met while studying on the Jazz Degree at Middlesex University in London; vocalist Kerry Andrew became involved with the group through the promoter Moose Factory. Kerry also sings with the highly respected vocal trio Juice, who won second prize at the prestigious Tampere Vocal Festival in June 2007; alto sax player Chris Williams is also part of 2009 Mercury Prize nominated group Led Bib. Tenor/soprano sax player John Martin is a successful bandleader in his own right; his band The John Martin Quartet have a new album out on the F-ire label this May. Drummer Tom Greenhalgh also plays in the acclaimed group World Sanguine Report, led by Andrew Plummer, and double bass player Paul Sandy has worked with various groups such as Hey Negrita. BBC New Generation Artist Shabaka Hutchings guests on the title track of the album on bass clarinet. The composer and arranger of the music on the album, pianist Laura Cole, draws heavily on her experience of RSI as a musician, and the subsequent depression that she battled with as a result. Now fully recovered, The Rock Between is an attempt to chart this journey through music and words. The album is a collection of largely song-based emotional journeys, juxtaposing original material and arrangements of well-known pieces, and comprises of tightly composed writing offset by improvised passages. The background to this music also draws from an interest in textures, music in dreams and the translation of transformative emotional experiences through composition and performance.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Rise To Remain are a London-based 5 piece metal band. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Rise To Remain are a London-based 5 piece metal band. They were formed in late 2006/early 2007 by Ben Tovey, Will Homer and Austin Dickinson under the name &#8220;Halide&#8221; as a side project to several of the band&#8217;s members other endeavours in music. Within a few months the band solidified their line-up and began playing local shows as well as travelling across the UK, seeking out shows. Halide recorded two EP&#8217;s, both of which saw a viral release through their Myspace, which eventually garnered attention from more legitimate local promoters, who granted the band further exposure by putting the band on at slightly higher profile shows. This opportunity lead to the band changing members and their name, switching from Halide, to Rise To Remain. Since then the band has been at its most active, and have toured with the likes of Shadows Fall, Five Finger Death Punch, The Haunted and Trivium, as well as appearing at Sonisphere Festival and Download Festival. On 14 June 2010, Rise to Remain were given the Metal Hammer Golden God Award, for &#8220;Best New Band, an award that was voted for by over 400,000 people across the globe.&#8221; The band has also been voted in to the shortlist for &#8220;Best British Newcomer&#8221; at the Kerrang! Awards. Recently signed to EMI.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Sarah Jane Morris Live</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;"Leave your preconceptions at home," begins one critic's assessment of sensual singer-songwriter Sarah Jane Morris, who straddles blues, rock, jazz and soul with a goosebump-raising four octave range that rumbles from the heels of her size nine shoes to the tips of her flame-red mane. Famed for her association with the Communards in the mid-80s and infamous for her banned cult rendition of the classic 'Me and Mrs Jones', Sarah Jane Morris has always attracted as much attention for her outspoken politics as for her soul-driven, seismic voice. Seven solo albums later, pop stardom on the continent, and a diverse set of musical collaborations on record, film and stage, Morris continues to steer her unorthodox career to greater heights. Some hear Sarah Vaughan or Billie Holliday in her voice, others cite Macy Gray and Erykah Badu, although Morris herself likes to say: "Nina Simone meets Janis Joplin." Yet always her own woman, Sarah Jane Morris is a truly independent spirit with a stunningly expressive voice who's been making exciting music for twenty-five years. Sarah Jane has recently released a stunning co-written and co-produced album entitled &#8220;Where it hurts&#8221;. The tracks are co-written with Dominic Miller (Sting&#8217;s right hand man and co-writer of &#8216;Shape My Heart&#8217;) and Martyn Barker (Billy Bragg and The Blokes). The Album was launched at Ronnie Scotts (London) and Blue Note (Milan). Her one woman show was previewed at the Edinburgh Festival to rave reviews in August, also called 'Where It Hurts' which is co-written with Michael Crompton (Silent Witness ) with Dominic Miller accompanying on guitar. This show is now touring the UK theatres and Arts Centres. It includes stories and songs from her childhood through to her collaboration on the song &#8216;Coal Not Dole&#8217; with Matt Fox (Happy End) and Kay Sutcliffe (a Kent Miners wife) for the miners strike, The Communards, nearly playing the part of Janis Joplin in the Paramount movie and beyond. Sarah Jane has just finished recording an incredible album live with 14 Cellos, nylon string guitar and voice which is going to be launched at the Auditorium in Rome this Summer.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Albert Ball's Flying Aces perform a wide repertoire from naive 1910s pop songs, early ragtime, jazz and blues, to exotic dance numbers and laments</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Performance details: Doors open at 7pm for diners, music starts at 8pm Albert Ball&#8217;s Flying Aces was originally formed in 1916 by the aviators of 266 Squadron RFC. To relieve the stress and horror of their daily aerial dog-fights high above the trenches, they used to gather in the evenings to play then-popular music on whatever instruments they could find, naming themselves after a famous airman of the time. Having settled in Paris following the 1918 Armistice, they now use their music and their wartime experiences to try to bring peace and understanding to a 1920s world, performing a wide repertoire ranging through naive 1910s pop songs, very early ragtime, jazz and blues, French and German polkas and chansons, exotic dance numbers and laments, Great War propaganda songs, music hall rabble-rousers and sentimental ballads - music which epitomises the spirit of that lost generation, resolutely jaunty and upbeat in the face of terrible loss and adversity...

  <short_description>Sputnik is in orbit, passenger jets are a bit ropey, but kinda ready, Chuck Berry is setting up the guitar solo for Marty McFly and we made it through WWII&#8230;hurrah! </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;So, it&#8217;s time to celebrate our victory in style hepcats. Your pants best be tight and your hair best be defying the laws of gravity. Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll has landed, and if you ain&#8217;t sweatin&#8217; it, you ain&#8217;t gettin&#8217; it. Vintage rockers have never come as energised as THE PICCADILLY BULLFROGS, and they leave no choice but to jive-it-up, like crazy twistin' tadpoles. Lovingly hand crafted from only the finest vintage components, this may be a small band, but it has a powerful, compelling sound - and a remarkable pedigree. 1950s Memphis Rock&#8217;nRoll is coming thick &amp; fast on what is destined to be a night of heated hip swinging mayhem, kickin&#8217; off with the explosive VOOLA &amp; THE JAYHAWKS. Screamin&#8217; Jay Hawkins himself would be proud to be backed by this musically-endowed get-up. The 1950s are upon us. Be ready. Upstairs at the Ritzy is the lovely bar and exciting venue above the Ritzy Cinema. We're open 7 nights a week and we pride ourselves on being a well-known &amp; well-loved cultural hub for Brixton. Our stage show-cases a consistently high standard of live music, from Reggae, Afro-beat &amp; Vintage-Swing, to World-Jazz, Folk, Blues, Balkan &amp; beyond! Plus we bring a monthly comedy feast, open mic, performance, workshops &amp; all sorts of exciting group activities. Full menu served all day till 8.30pm &#8211; so there&#8217;s eats to be had too!

  <short_description>The multi award-winning saxophonist and his superb quartet of Gary Crosby, Andrew McCormack and Rod Youngs perform an energetic and eclectic collection of new repertoire from the recent album release Identity By Subtraction</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Born in Hounslow, West London of St Lucian parents in 1969, Denys Baptiste is an award-winning jazz artist, composer and educator. An outstanding saxophonist of international acclaim, Denys is renowned for his ability to make complex music accessible, creating mature, melodic, and highly memorable compositions that lodge in the memory on first hearing. Be Where You Are &#8211; his 1999 debut album on independent jazz label, Dune Records &#8211; earned him a Mercury Music Prize for An Album Of The Year and a MOBO award for Best Jazz Act. He followed this in 2001 with his second album, Alternating Currents (Dune Records DUNECD05) also receiving great critical acclaim. 2003 saw the release of his third, and most ambitious, recording/touring project to date: Let Freedom Ring! (Dune Records DUNECD010), an inspirational, uplifting suite combining contemporary jazz, gospel, blues, and Afro-Cuban music with extracts of the epic poem, Mental Fight by Booker Prize-winning author, Ben Okri who narrates on this piece. Commissioned by the Cheltenham Jazz Festival/Jerwood Foundation, Let Freedom Ring! commemorated the 40th anniversary of the historic &#8216;I Have A Dream&#8217; oration by American black civil rights activist, Dr Martin Luther King and was nominated for Best Album and Best New Work in the BBC Jazz Awards, for Best Jazz Act in the MOBO (Music Of Black Origin) Awards and Best Album in the UK Parliamentary Jazz Awards. Identity By Subtraction is Baptiste&#8217;s latest studio recording first released in December 2010 with a CD release in January 2011, and is a collage of thoughts and improvisations that together create an image that represent the artist's responses to life's experience as a black man of Caribbean descent playing jazz music in the UK today. This is his first release in quartet format since his Mercury-nominated debut, Be Where You Are, and alongside him on tenor and soprano saxophone are pianist Andrew McCormack, double bassist Gary Crosby and drummer Rod Youngs. Awards: Mercury Music Prize - Album of The Year 1999, MOBO Awards - Best Jazz Act 1999, British Jazz Awards - Rising Star 2000 Nominations: BBC Jazz Awards - Best Album 2004, BBC Jazz Awards - Best New Work 2004, MOBO Awards - Best Jazz Act 2004, Parliamentary Jazz Awards - Best Album 2004&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>A very special double-headline night of music with two rapidly upcoming acts, one homegrown and one from the other side of the Atlantic, both promoting new singles. Impress your friends by saying you were here!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;SARABETH TUCEK Brooklyn-based singer Sarabeth Tucek comes to Bath with her hauntingly beautiful dusky, desert folk. Influenced by Dylan and Cat Stevens, her singing voice has been compared to Karen Carpenter and her style to Cat Power and Neil Young. Her first single, &#8220;Something For You&#8221;, became single of the week twice on Steve Lamacq&#8217;s influential BBC radio show, and was also famously covered by The Brian Jonestown Massacre. Produced by Ethan Johns (Kings Of Leon) and Luther Russell (Richmond Fontaine, Noah &amp; The Whale), her eponymous debut album received rapturous reviews, leading to shows with Bob Dylan himself. Sarabeth comes to Bath as part of her UK tour promoting her &#8220;luminescent&#8221; (NME) second album, also produced by Luther Russell, and fresh of the back of releasing her new single &#8216;Smile for no one&#8217; via Sonic Cathedral Recordings. www.sarabethtucek.wordpress.com www.facebook.com/sarabethtucek &#8220;Something for you &#8211; the most beautiful single of the year&#8221; - NME &#8220;All hail the new queen of folky torchsong&#8221; - MOJO &#8220;Amazingly accomplished&#8221; &#8211; Sunday Times URUSEN Returning to their roots in Bath for this single release tour, Urusen are a band beginning to make waves on the UK music scene. Described as one of BBC Introducing&#8217;s festival highlights, and predicted by the music industries magazine Music Week as &#8220;destined to make an impact&#8221; Urusen combine the best of the current British indie-folk with great contemporary American bands like Midlake and The National, as they shift effortlessly between something intrinsically English, yet akin to the epic Midwest. With an eclectic array of mostly acoustic instruments and a lyrical, story-telling signature to their songs, Urusen&#8217;s gigs will take you on an epic music journey. The band were spotted in 2010 by renowned UK producer Steve Osborne (KT Tunstall, Elbow, Cat&#8217;s Eyes) and have since recorded an album at Peter Gabriel&#8217;s Realworld Studios. This event marks their first single release from this forthcoming album, and a very limited edition double A-side vinyl will be available to buy, as well as a free download from their website. www.urusen.co.uk www.facebook.com/urusen &#8220;One to watch&#8221; - The Metro &#8220;Great act, a stunning show&#8221; - James Shepard, Festival Director, Larmer Tree &#8220;Alongside Stornorway, my favorite act on the Avalon Caf&#233; Stage. Great music, the crowds loved them, and surely only a matter of time until they are on Jules Holland&#8221; - Lisa Pickering, Avalon Stage Coordinator, Glastonbury Festival TICKETS http://www.chapelarts.org/events/?regevent_action=register&amp;event_id=122&amp;name_of_event=Sarabeth+Tucek+&amp;Urusen___support WEBSITE http://www.chapelarts.org/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>This band finally formed into Bruce LOK in 2010. According to Bruce, the name &#8220;Bruce LOK&#8221; came from &#8220;John Locke&#8221; and lead singer used Locke&#8217;s theories of mind as he was questioning life and was finding difficulty of knowing who he was as an artist </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;In 2009, at age 20, vocalist Mitchell Bruce moved to London where he met manager Rebecca Pink-Hayes while he was attending a private school. Shortly after arriving, he began taking vocal lessons with Nick Charters. Prior to forming Bruce Lok, Bruce and the lead guitarist were both in separate bands, one listed as the Gina Sykes project and Mitchell Bruce was in a experimental rock and metal band as a solo artist . The band eventually formed in 2010 as Bruce LOK. According to Bruce, the name &#8220;Bruce LOK&#8221; came from &#8220;John Locke&#8221; and lead singer used Locke&#8217;s theories of mind as he was questioning life and was finding difficulty of knowing who he was as an artist which came in to play with John Locke&#8217;s origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self , he then experimented with abstract and alternative and experimental music to portray Locke&#8217;s continuity of consciousness and wanted to convey the idea that the mind was a blank state or tabula rasa having the idea that music and knowledge is instead determined only by experience and derived from sense perceptions. Over the following year , Bruce LOK performed at various venue Inside of greater london area . Bruce lok are currently in the process of recording there official album with producer John Henry Poole (Cinematic orchestra, Jack Panate, ladyhawke). Members: Mitchell Bruce: Lead Vocals and Keyboard, Tom Eatherton: Backing vocals and Lead guitar, Daniel Voysey: Rhythm Guitar, Joey Rossi: Bass, Reuben Humphries: Drums, Elliot Lyte: Violin, Mikey Cooper: Viola, Sophie English: Cello With Guests: SHURA // HIATUS , Candytree, Sunday Night Club, 308, Mercury Rising Doors: 6:30 p.m. Tickets: &#163;8 on the door&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>After three sell-out successes at the Edinburgh Festival and direct from their 60-date UK tour 'More hairdresser than barbershop', 4 Poofs and a Piano are making a welcome return to the stage with a brand-new show entitled Back in Business.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Presented by Sam Joseph After three sell-out successes at the Edinburgh Festival and direct from their 60-date UK tour 'More hairdresser than barbershop', 4 Poofs and a Piano - Ian Parkin, Stephen De Martin, David Roper and David Wickenden - are making a welcome return to the stage with a brand-new show entitled Back in Business. Having filmed 16 series as the house band on the BBC, BAFTA and comedy award-winning Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, 4 Poofs and their piano have introduced guests ranging from Meryl Streep, Lionel Richie and Tom Jones to Will Young, Tom Hanks and John Travolta. They sang with Neil Diamond on ITV's An Audience with Neil Diamond and also with Jimmy Osmond on Richard and Judy&#8217;s New Position. In December 2005 they released their first CD Screaming Party Anthems with Virgin EMI and make regular appearances at the world-famous Glastonbury Festival. In this fabulous new show the famous foursome are back with another helping of frisky footwork and musical madness. Back in Business sees the boys returning with their popular brand of irreverent humour together with lush harmonies. "Fun, outrageous and rarely in the best possible taste" "There could be five poofs and two pianos soon" Elton John "Great band" Enrique Iglesias "Very impressive" Anastasia "These boys have enough panache to fill an entire jewel box... innovative, funny, genuine talent... don't miss" The Scotsman "Riotous exuberance of this standard comes but once a year" The Scotsman "Has you crossing your legs with delight" Mail on Sunday&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

They have since established themselves as one of the foremost recorder consorts of their generation, and an ensemble of unique appeal to a wide range of audiences. Founded out of a shared love of consort music and recorders, Consortium have performed in Europe and the UK at major festivals and concert series. In 2010 they recorded their debut album on the Nonclassical Label, voted the best album of 2010 by Chicago Time Out. Working with composers has formed a central part of Consortium5's activity over the past four years, and this album features works commissioned especially for and by the group. A recent review from the influential blog Sequenza21 concludes that the album &#8216;suggests a new frontier for chamber ensembles&#8217;. Winners of numerous prizes and awards, Consortium5 made their Purcell Room debut in 2009 as part of the Park Lane Group Young Artists Series. In 2007-2009 they were Joan Greenfield Junior Fellows at Trinity College of Music and in 2006 they were awarded the Deutsche Bank Pyramid Award for performance, a prize that allowed them to invest in a set of 10 matching consort instruments. Equally committed to performance on the concert platform and in the community, Consortium5 spent several years resident on the Live Music Now scheme, and have performed numerous concerts for London based music services, reaching over 7000 children, many of whom had never attended a professional music concert before. Since forming, Consortium5 have combined historically informed and contemporary performance to great effect in both concerts and educational work. Consortium5 enjoy working closely with composers throughout the composition process and it has been their great delight to discover the fascination these instruments hold for composers and the richness and variety with which their language speaks through the consort. Consortium5 are particularly interested in the bridges that these compositions build; new consorts from the archaic consort form, new works for ancient instruments, a contemporary dimension to the recorder that concentrates without compromise on both its simplicity and its myriad complexities. Dine at Caponata....... Please ring 02073875959 to book a table or click here. Please note that it is not possible to dine during this performance..&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Errol Linton is a harmonica player and vocalist.

"A friend sold me a harmonica, I picked it up one day, started blowing on it, never stopped," says Linton. "The harmonica lead me to the blues."

</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;In 1991 a chance meeting with John Walters, BBC Radio 2 producer led to a radio session on the Andy Kershaw Show and in 1993 Errol was featured along side Big Bill Broonzy in BBC 2&#8217;s Arena documentary (Rhythms of the World) called Two Generations of the Blues. Linton released his first album Vibin&#8217; It (Ruby Records) in 1998. Across the UK BBC Radio DJs Charlie Gillett, Paul Jones, John Peel and Andy Kershaw all played the album. In 2001 Linton returned to the studio to cut Roots Stew (Ruby Records). Roots Stew shows Errol&#8217;s song writing developing alongside the band&#8217;s organic blues-reggae groove. You can hear Linton&#8217;s harmonica on Channel 4&#8217;s documentary &#8217;Mr. Rock and Roll&#8217; Transglobal Underground albums &#8216;Rejoice Rejoice&#8217; (Nations Records 1998) and &#8216;Yes Boss Food Corner&#8217; (Ark 1 Records 2001) double CD compilation Beyond Mississippi (Manteca 2002) and Abram Wilson&#8217;s album Ride! Ferris Wheel To The Modern Day Delta&#8217; (Dune Records 2007). Live, Errol and Co. play with a ragged, fluid grace. The Band constitute guitarist Adam Blake, bass player Neal Charles and drummer Kenrick Rowe. Lead by Linton they create an urban sound with rural roots. Some songs are tough rockers designed to get crowds dancing. Others have a soulful ska and reggae vibe his songs have a slangy, street poetry that stick in your head, long after they finish. Linton&#8217;s has opened the show for Screaming Jay Hawkins, Bo Diddley, Dr John and Blind Boys of Alabama. Linton&#8217;s new material &#8217;Mama Said&#8217; has contributions from noted New Orleans trumpeter Abram Wilson and Serb pianist Pete Zivkovic. The resulting songs range from &#8216;Stressed Out&#8217; &#8211; a blues every Londoner can relate to &#8211; to the beautiful acoustic reflections of &#8216;Roll On Tomorrow&#8217;. On these recordings Linton demonstrates how his song writing has matured into a remarkable original vision.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Esa-Pekka Salonen opens the Philharmonia's 2011/12 season with Sibelius's epic and rarely-performed 'choral symphony' Kullervo. Sibelius's epic 'choral symphony' Kullervo was written some eight years before his conventional First Symphony, when the composer was just 27 years old. Its five movements depict the exploits of the hero of the great Finnish mythic poem, the Kalevala, and chronicle different parts of his complex, tragic personality and of his life, including his childhood in slavery, his seduction of his own sister and his atonement on the battlefield for her subsequent suicide. Scored for male chorus, soloists and orchestra, this is an extraordinary piece of choral writing of dramatic power, rarely heard in the concert hall due to its sheer size and scale. FREE Pre-concert recital by Orphei Dr&#228;nger in the Royal Festival Hall at 6pm.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Conor Owen is an exciting maturing UK singer songwriter who combines an acoustic melodic style with a powerful lyrical prowess. The singer&#8217;s key influences are both contemporary and classic including John Martyn, Damien Rice, Nick Drake and Ray LaMontagne &#8211; and this is the launch show for his debut single &#8216;There&#8217;s Only You&#8217;. Conor follows this with the release of &#8216;The Observationalist&#8217; &#8211; his debut solo album. The album is an honest and heart felt interpretation of life, family and relationships as Conor sees them. The album has a distinctly anthemic feel to it featuring lavish string sections in songs such as &#8217;Softly Softly&#8217; and &#8216;There&#8217;s Only You&#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

The Dead Lay Waiting are a 5 piece Metal band from Swindon.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Dead Lay Waiting are a 5 piece band from Swindon. They started writing music together in 2007, almost immediately making an instant impact on the local scene opening and supporting bands such as: Aborted, Abagail Williams, Argent Dawn and Eternal Lord. The band went to record their first E.P "Memories Of A Massacre" at "Studio 6" in late 2007 which was then followed by a self-titled E.P in early 2008. They then started to get recognised out of their local scene due to the release of their self titled E.P and started touring the U.K. Mid 2008 The Dead Lay Waiting performed in Ipswich and spotted by the well acclaimed "Rising Records" (Trigger The Bloodshed, Bleed From Within, Mendeed) and signed a U.K and Europe 5 year contract; which saw the band to record their debut album "We Rise" in Jan 2009. Their debut album was released in Jan 2010 and produced the sound the band had worked very hard to achieve. After playing a major festival every year (Bloodstock 2008, Hammerfest 2009, Download Festival 2010) and playing to packed out crowds every year, has proven the band are more than capable playing on the big stage. With a fan base growing worldwide the band have hit the studio in 2010 to record their follow up to "We Rise" and are ready to take on anything anywhere, and perform their bone crushing live performance across the world.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Society are a three piece country rock band from West Sussex who specialize in gorgeous three part harmonies that set them apart from the current crop of Americana or West Coast rock wanabees in the UK. Society comprise of guitarist Matt Wise, bassist Ben Lancaster and on all things percussive F.Scott Kenny. Their recorded and live sound has echoes of C.S.N.Y, The Band, The Heartbreakers, The Jayhawks and the late great Ronnie Lane and Slim Chance. Matt Wise composes most if not all of their material and when all three sing in harmony the result is simply stunning. Since forming in 2004 Society have supported many great visiting artistes when they toured the UK, opening for notable musicians and performers such as Eve Selis, Deadstring Brothers, Corb Lund, Luke Doucet and The Wailin' Jennys. Apart from their own UK headline shows, Society have completed two tours of Canada along with a string of dates in the American mid-west gaining a whole new legion of fans in the USA. This constant touring has honed both their musical and vocal chops and in the winter of 2008 Society left their disused stable that served as their rehearsal space and spent time at The Brickhouse Studios near Brighton recording their debut release entitled Songs From The Brickhouse.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

The Shoestrung Although only young, they have long since sold their collective souls to the Devil, who almost gave up waiting at the crossroads, as no lost souls had past for many moons. That is however, until these young fellas rocked up and asked him to re-tune their guitars in the darkness&#8230;&#8230;.With a rich heritage of music flowing through their collective DNA, The Shoestrung sound collides Howlin&#8217; Wolf, The Small Faces, Muddy Waters &amp; The Stones (to name just a few!!) with their raw energy and youthful exuberance to devastating effect!! www.myspace.com/theshoestrung DJ Count Sizzle is a Dj/compare/promoter/compiler and collector of Antique Afro-American &amp; Vintage Voodoo Music from the 1920&#8242;s-1960&#8242;s. Spinning cool underground bygone-boppers on 78 and 45rpm. All Killers, No fillers!

  <short_description>This event is over two nights.  Starting Friday 30th and finishing Saturday 1st October.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Line up Friday: Dirty Ray - After disbanding Immaculate Fools in 1995, having released six albums over an eleven year period, Ray headed for Spain, returning to a people that had already taken his poetic song writing well and truly to their collective heart. Ray spent several years immersing himself in Spain&#8217;s traditional music, the Flamenco of the south and further North, in Galicia, he wrestled with the complicated acoustic guitar rhythms of the chant based alalas songs, fusing these styles with his already deeply ingrained love of Delta Blues, (think; better dressed Seasick Steve with a passion for Tapas) until perfecting his now peculiarly individual style of treating the acoustic guitar. Dan Donnelly is a guitarist and singer/songwriter from New York, originally from Belfast. A contemporary Irish songwriter in the style of Paul Brady, Van Morrison and Bono. Ian Prowse, the vocalist and guitarist from Amsterdam. He formed Amsterdam in 1999 with cousin Johnny Barlow and former Blow Monkeys drummer Tony Kiley but didn't secure a record deal until September 2004 when the band were signed to new label Beat Crazy. During this time Amsterdam struck up a friendship with Elvis Costello who used Amsterdam[3] as his backing band on the Jonathan Ross television show as well as opening act on several occasions. The relationship was blessed on record when Prowse performed a duet with Costello on a cover of The Searchers 1964 hit 'Don't throw your love away' for the Liverpool Number Ones Project on EMI Records in 2008. Tonight performing solo. Jim Bob (Carter USM). After years of pop struggle Jim would release his first records with the band Jamie Wednesday, whose horn section Jim would work with again fumfty years later when Jim was reading a book about learning to play the recorder and discovered it was written by Jamie Wednesday sax player Simon. After Jamie Wednesday Jim Bob formed Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine with guitarist Fruitbat. Together as Carter they would have 14 top 40 singles and a number one album, selling over a million records and touring the world. With Carter, Jim Bob would become known for his socially aware pop lyrics and in particular his use of puns. and last but by no means least The Wonderstuff's Miles Hunt &amp; Erica Nockalls Saturday Night Line up: Special guests to be annouced Timothy Parkes - Guitarist and singer songwriter featured on the Shared Album. Smoke Feathers - Check out their new album on myspace The Wonderstuff's Miles &amp; Erica Dolittle (Ange) - playing acoustic versions of old and new material.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Mixing traditional Flamenco with dazzling solo improvisation and soulful rhythms, Kevin Byrne, Cuffy and Ivan Moreno make each performance a unique and exciting event.
 
Joined by La Ambar - a Flamenco Dancer trained in the heart of Andalusia.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;An exciting and dynamic flamenco trio. Their unique sound, while based on the core of two guitars and cajon, is endlessly varied by the use of vocals, palmas bouzouki &amp; percussion. Be transported to hot southern climes and bask in the seductive rhythms of Flamenco with &#8220;the best guitar-led band going&#8221; &#8211; Calima. Mixing traditional Flamenco with dazzling solo improvisation and soulful rhythms, Kevin Byrne, Cuffy and Ivan Moreno make each performance a unique and exciting event. Joined at the Chapel Arts Centre by La Ambar, a Flamenco Dancer trained in the heart of Andalusia, Dance, Guitar and Caj&#243;n percussion come together as one. The caj&#243;n creates the heartbeat of the music, lending an extra depth and complexity, with percussive improvisation to perfectly accompany and complement the complexities of the guitar. The guitars perform dazzling displays of flamenco's intricate rhythms and thrilling changes of pace, moving from fast and furious beats to lyrical, almost pensive moods with beautiful fluidity. Finally the dancer, with all the passion born of her love for this art form, lays bare her soul and brings the music to a dramatic climax of fast footwork and proud expression. Join us for Anochecer Flamenco &#8211; an evening of Flamenco not to be forgotten!

  <short_description>If you missed their knockout debut at The Forge last season, don&#8217;t make the same mistake twice!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;This exciting new project from trumpeter Nick Smart has been thrilling audiences around London and makes a welcome return to Forge. The band brings together three of the most engaging and innovative jazz musicians on the current scene, with three of the most dynamic performers from the Afro-Cuban and World music scene. The "Jazz Matanzas" project is named after the region of Cuba famed for traditional Afro-Cuban music, and from where bassist Martinez and conga player Noda originally hail. The music brings together the influences from these two musical approaches, fusing jazz harmony with different rhythmic concepts. The programme is a combination of originals by Smart and Khan, and compositions of his closest musical friends and influences, including pieces by Kenny Wheeler and Stan Sulzmann in new arrangements for "Jazz Matanzas".

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Out of the delightfully twisted remains of the artists formerly known as Fantasmagoria, staggered a crazed singer-accordionist with a clutch of songs used and new, and often misappropriated... A bohemianaut is one who travels through uncharted spaces towards some notion of "bohemia", and The Bohemianauts are a mutable combo of such travellers, playing and singing as they go, featuring: Tom Baker on accordion, Raf Lijtman on guitar, Laurence Eliott-Potter on piano and Nick Doyne-Ditmas on double bass&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The multi award-winning saxophonist and his superb quartet featuring pianist Andrew McCormack, double bassist Gary Crosby and drummer Rod Youngs</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Denys Baptiste is an award-winning jazz artist, composer and educator. An outstanding saxophonist of international acclaim, Denys is renowned for his ability to make complex music accessible, creating mature, melodic, and highly memorable compositions that lodge in the memory on first hearing. Be Where You Are &#8211; his 1999 debut album on independent jazz label, Dune Records &#8211; earned him a Mercury Music Prize for An Album Of The Year and a MOBO award for Best Jazz Act. He followed this in 2001 with his second album, Alternating Currents (Dune Records DUNECD05) also receiving great critical acclaim. 2003 saw the release of his third, and most ambitious, recording/touring project to date: Let Freedom Ring! (Dune Records DUNECD010), an inspirational, uplifting suite combining contemporary jazz, gospel, blues, and Afro-Cuban music with extracts of the epic poem, Mental Fight by Booker Prize-winning author, Ben Okri who narrates on this piece. Commissioned by the Cheltenham Jazz Festival/Jerwood Foundation, Let Freedom Ring! commemorated the 40th anniversary of the historic &#8216;I Have A Dream&#8217; oration by American black civil rights activist, Dr Martin Luther King and was nominated for Best Album and Best New Work in the BBC Jazz Awards, for Best Jazz Act in the MOBO (Music Of Black Origin) Awards and Best Album in the UK Parliamentary Jazz Awards. Identity By Subtraction is Baptiste&#8217;s latest studio recording first released in December 2010 with a CD release in January 2011, and is a collage of thoughts and improvisations that together create an image that represent the artist's responses to life's experience as a black man of Caribbean descent playing jazz music in the UK today. This is his first release in quartet format since his Mercury-nominated debut, Be Where You Are, and alongside him on tenor and soprano saxophone are pianist Andrew McCormack, double bassist Gary Crosby and drummer Rod Youngs. Awards: Mercury Music Prize - Album of The Year 1999, MOBO Awards - Best Jazz Act 1999, British Jazz Awards - Rising Star 2000 Nominations: BBC Jazz Awards - Best Album 2004, BBC Jazz Awards - Best New Work 2004, MOBO Awards - Best Jazz Act 2004, Parliamentary Jazz Awards - Best Album 2004&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

My Sleeping Karma combines the organic aspect of psychedelic groove rock with emotional shades of aphasian landscapes. That was the inTention of the debut album and it still remains. Guitar, bass and drums in love with a soundboard. My Sleeping Karma's album "Satya" released september 20th on Elektrohasch Records. And time is the major keyword in the context of "Satya". The conditioned mind is always moving between the past and future, and this movement activity creates the illusion of time. Use your illusion and you will discover the voice within.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Jazz and folk blend with jazz favourites, energetic folk and original compositions. Three Piece Suite perform concerts all over the West Country and further afield. Combining their skills of classical guitar, jazz piano and folk fiddle, plus vocals, the unique repertoire of Three Piece Suite includes jazz arrangements of classical guitar numbers, energetic folk sets and songs and well known jazz favourites. Seamlessly moving through the styles, Three Piece Suite provide an evening of first class entertainment. Young musicians are encouraged in Three Piece Suite concerts and talented young classical pianist, Finn shields, will be giving a cameo performance during the evening. Three Piece Suite John Hooper jazz piano and vocals Helen James guitar and vocals Ali Nourse fiddle and vocals John, Helen and Ali who form the unique jazz and folk trio, Three Piece Suite, perform concerts all over the West Country and further afield to delighted audiences. Combining their skills of classical guitar, jazz piano and folk fiddle, plus vocal harmonies, their repertoire ranges from classical interpretations of Concerto de Aranjuez, wild and earthy and soul searching folk melodies and songs, through to the jazz favourites of Gershwin, Cole Porter, Hoagy Carmichel and Louis Armstrong. John Hooper is an outstanding jazz pianist with over 30 television and 200 Radio Broadcasts to his credit. He was the founder pianist with Bristol&#8217;s legendary Blue Note Jazz Band and later formed a jazz trio often featuring Bristol&#8217;s dynamic jazz singer, Kate McNabb. The trio had a regular Radio Two slot, &#8220;You &amp; The Night &amp; The Music&#8221;. John has played concerts across Europe, at the Albert Hall, the Berlin Philharmonic Hall and has performed with Acker Bilk and the Blue Notes at Bristol&#8217;s Colston Hall. He has also had the privilege of performing with some of America&#8217;s Jazz greats. Classical guitarist Helen James combines a pure classical tone with the lightness and freedom of folk music and the energy of flamenco. Trained at the Welsh College of Music and Drama, Helen James has a wealth of experience performing both classical guitar and folk music either as a soloist or in small ensembles, in concerts, playing for private functions, arts centres and music festivals. Helen is an accomplished singer with a smooth and pure vocal tone which she adapts for folk and jazz styles. Helen composes music, both songs and instrumentals and runs her own private teaching practice near Bath. Ali Nourse, a music teacher in Bath, has been steeped in folk music since the age of fourteen and has performed fiddle at many of the UK&#8217;s major folk festivals during her busy musical career. Classically trained at Dartington College on violin, piano and as a vocalist, Ali Nourse is an energetic fiddler with raw energy and dynamism and her heart is with folk music. This is genuine folk, played from the soul. Finn Shields is a talented young classical pianist and has performed many times as a guest of Three Piece Suite. A pupil at Beechen Cliff School, Bath, Finn is hoping to study music at University and is developing a mature repertoire, which includes Rachmaninov, Debussy and Chopin. He has played many times in public, most recently in the Bath Young Musician competition, where he was runner up. &#8220;What we play is life&#8221; Louis Armstrong: Combining musicianship honed by life experience with exuberance and humour, Three Piece Suite take you on an unforgettable musical journey! More information is on www.keyna.co.uk Cruse Bereavement Care is a major national charity whose purpose is to help people understand their grief and cope with their loss. A range of services is available including telephone support, Friendship and Support Groups and individual counselling sessions. People of all ages are helped and there is a specially trained group of Bereavement Volunteers who can work with children from the age of three. The area covered by this branch of the charity is very large and includes Bradford on Avon, Calne, Devizes, Chippenham, Shepton Mallet, Warminster and areas in between and of course, Bath. The cost to the charity of helping each client is approximately &#163;150 and the cost to the client is nothing. On average Bath and District Cruse helps 500 clients a year and we have to work hard to maintain funds to pay for this service so that it remains free. In line with every other charity we are finding it difficult to keep going financially and although we are part of a national organisation, we receive no financial support from them. We rely on grants from beneficial bodies and donations and also have a busy fund raising programme. Events like this concert are vital to our continued existence and we are very grateful for your support!

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Christ Agony is a Polish black metal band formed in 1990 in Olsztyn, Poland, by Cezary "Cezar" Augustynowicz (vocals &amp; guitar), &#379;urek (drums), and Ash (bass &amp; vocals). After the second album the line-up changed frequently between recordings. The band dissolved in 2003 due to a conflict with a record label, and released one album under the name Union. In 2007, the band reformed.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Lola Perrin and Alexis Kirke present an evening of film, music and words inspired by a landmark fossil discovery by Dr Adam Maloof</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Doors open at 6:30pm, performance begins at 7pm When Earth&#8217;s oceans were covered with ice from pole to pole and the temperature was around -74&#176;F, &#8220;one animal somewhere must have survived so that it could continue on and eventually become humans&#8221;. So says Princeton geologist Dr Adam Maloof, and he must know as he headed the team that made the fossil discovery pushing back the first appearance of animals 70 million years to before one of the great ice ages. Lola Perrin and Alexis Kirke present an evening of film, music and words inspired by the story of the fossil find and its implications for a new understanding of our origins. In the final part of the concert Dr Adam Maloof will be in conversation with natural history filmmaker, writer and conservationist Paul Williams who will also moderate questions from the audience. Naim is delighted to be working with Lola and proud to be a supporter of tonight's performance.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;William Tyler is well-known for his work as part of Lambchop and Silver Jews and has just released the album 'Behold The Spirit'. His recent tour dates supporting Yo La Tengo caused a whole heap of excitement in the US, and he's now he's coming to spread the magic over here. Reactions to the album have been widely euphoric, Pitchfork talking of "the grace and elocution of Behold the Spirit, the debut from young Nashville guitarist William Tyler. Arguably the most vital, energized album by an American solo guitarist in a decade or more, it accepts Fahey's legacy while escaping its shadow. Moreover, it's simply a joy to hear." Hiss Golden Messenger "Bad Debt recalls the ragged blues and front-porch musicians of eras long since gone and modern folk legends like Bonnie 'Prince' Billy and Iron &amp; Wine, only with more edge than Sam Beam, more understatement than Will Oldham, and with a little Hank Williams tossed in for good measure" Mezzic.com "Mystical country. An eerie yellowing photograph." David Bowie "Fans of Will Oldham and Bill Callahan will find much to admire" The Guardian "a thing of gentle charm &amp; unmistakable cosmic American beauty. It is, for those of us who delight in the likes of Iron &amp; Wine, our first contact with a new &amp; wonderful songwriter" Independent "nine folk-soul nuggets... these are powerful songs" Uncut TICKETS http://www.chapelarts.org/events/?regevent_action=register&amp;event_id=109&amp;name_of_event=Hiss+Golden+Messenger+&amp;William_Tyler WEBSITE http://www.chapelarts.org/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Italian-born Ezio and Mark 'Booga' Fowell, hailing from Cambridge, have developed their own sensitive style, a mixture of rock and folk full of gorgeous acoustic melodies and intelligent lyrics. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Since the early 90s Ezio have gigged, made albums, been signed numerous times, been dropped nearly as many, travelled all over the world, more gigs, fired managers, been rich, been broke, been chubby, and thinner, then chubbier, had rave reviews, been blessed with faint criticism. They have built up large and loyal followings at home and abroad, frequently described as &#8220;easily one of Britain&#8217;s best live bands&#8221;, with their last album, "10,000 Bars" getting 4/5 reviews in such disparate publications as "The Sun" &amp; "Maverick Magazine". So how do you survive so long in such a cut throat, fickle, fashion driven business? See an Ezio show, visit the website &amp; check out their new album (Title T.B.C) &amp; the answer might be there.

  <short_description>A former opera singer and fisheries biologist, Anna Coogan has been charming audiences across the world in four languages (English,German, French, and (some) Italian) with her dark indie-folk.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;A former opera singer and fisheries biologist, Anna Coogan has been charming audiences across the world in four languages (English,German, French, and (some) Italian) with her dark indie-folk. Maverick magazine described her sound as &#8220;Fantastic new music&#8230;Americana at its best&#8221;, and Blurt Magazine staunchly declared her &#8220;one of the best of her breed.&#8221; In 2009, only a year into her solo career, Anna Coogan debuted in Europe at the Blue Balls Festival in Luzern, Switzerland, opening for German legends Reamonn. Shortly thereafter she released The Nocturnal Among Us, produced by JD Foster (Patty Griffin, Calexico), which debuted at #1 on the Euro-Americana charts and #26 the Freeform Americana Charts in the US. Two US and three European tours quickly followed, including spots on the BBC, The Belladrum Festival (Scotland), Celtic Connections Festival (Scotland), Club Passim (Boston), The Triple Door (Seattle), The Aladdin Theater (Portland), The Jumpin&#8217; Hot Club (Newcastle, UK), In The Woods (NL) and packed houses across the UK, Netherlands and Northern Germany. She has shared the stage with artists as diverse as Eddie Spaghetti, Reamonn, Alison Brown, Joy Kills Sorrow, Lambchop, Fred Eaglesmith, and many others. Anna has also played live on trendsetter Seattle station KEXP and spent 13 weeks at the top of their charts. Anna is currently set to release her fourth full-length record, The Wasted Ocean, on Sept 18, 2011 in Europe and in January 2012 in the US. Beautifully crafted and oddly unsettling, The Wasted Ocean places Anna&#8217;s incomparable voice front and center. Driving banjos, soaring guitars, and swelling strings fuse Coogan&#8217;s indie-pop sensibilities with her Americana roots. Coogan&#8217;s most complex and engaging work to date, The Wasted Ocean is produced by Evan Brubaker and features Eyvind Kang (Bill Frisell, Laura Viers), Edie Carey, (Shawn Mullins) Darrin Watkins (Vicki Martinez), and Colby Sander (Rachel Harrington), as well as long time collaborators Eric Hastings, Brooks Miner, and Daniele Fiaschi.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Autumn 2011 marks the debut of The Orain Series - a new non-profit project of registered charity St. Margaret's House showcasing three of the most widely acclaimed folk artists in the UK - Dougie MacLean, Heidi Talbot and James Yorkston.
</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Staged in the stunning and intimate venue of St Matthew's Church the evening promises a captivating live music experience. Doors open at 6pm, show starts at 7 pm. On Heidi Talbot: Ireland has long been a fount of great female singers, but Heidi Talbot's breakthrough solo release, 2008's In Love + Light, swiftly assured her promotion to the premier league. Its artfully chosen mix of traditional and contemporary material, reinvented classics and little-known gems, and above all Heidi's's achingly bittersweet, spun-gold voice, won glowing reviews across three continents, a US Indie Acoustic Award and a Best Female Vocalist nomination in the Irish Music Awards. With critics mooting comparisons as diverse as Bj&#246;rk, Enya, Linda Ronstadt, Norah Jones and Kirsty MacColl, the album received widespread radio airplay and has been followed by two years' solid gigging, both as headline act and sought-after special guest. Heidi&#8217;s hotly anticipated follow-up album The Last Star released in 2010 has marked the artist&#8217;s debut foray into songwriting. It also sees her engaging afresh with her traditional roots, while seeking out rarely- or never-recorded contemporary material. "Talbot is primed and ready for crossover success." (Colin Irwin, Daily Telegraph) "An engaging and impressive record." (Robin Denselow, The Guardian) Purchase tickets online at www.seetickets.com.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Anekdoten is a Swedish progressive rock band, made up of guitarist/vocalist Nicklas Barker, cellist Anna Sofi Dahlberg, bassist/vocalist Jan Erik Liljestr&#246;m and drummer Peter Nordins. They are notable for the use of the mellotron and the heavy, trippy sound, dominated by a bass guitar. Their music is associated with the tradition of 1970s progressive rock music, especially King Crimson, but they have also covered songs by Van Der Graaf Generator and Magma in their live performances.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

A compilation of the videos made from this first album also earned the band a gold video award. L.A. Guns went into the studio to record their second album, &#8220;Cocked and Loaded&#8221;, in the spring of 1989. It was a hit right away with the release of &#8220;Rip and Tear&#8221; as the first single and video. &#8220;Never Enough&#8221; and &#8220;The Ballad of Jayne&#8221; followed, pushing album sales over 1,000,000 and earning the band its first platinum record award.

With the release of &#8220;Kiss My Love Goodbye&#8221; as the first single and video, and another successful world tour, the album went on to sell 700,000 copies and earned the band its third gold album award.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Singer and composer Fini Bearman is already being cited as one of the UK's leading contemporary jazz vocalists. Recently nominated for Jazz Vocalist 2010 alongside Norma Winstone and Ian Shaw by The Global Music Foundation, Fini's heartfelt delivery and choice of song makes her an exciting, unique performer, and definitely a musician to watch. The new album, 'Step Up', is being released in September, and is a collection of original songs by Fini, influenced by Wayne Shorter, Kurt Rosenwinkel and Gretchen Parlato, and features Rick Simpson on piano, Tom Farmer on bass and Josh Morrison on drums. Largely inspired by Martin Read (composer and head of Music at Alton College) Fini discovered the world of Jazz. She went on to complete a BMus in Music at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London, and graduated in July 2007. Whilst there, Fini studied with some of the country&#8217;s top musicians, including Martin Hathaway, Pete Churchill, Anita Wardell, and Martin Speake. In the winter of 2008, deciding to further her studies, focusing on composition, Fini applied to study at the Jazz Institute Berlin, where she went on to spend 18 months under the tuition of renowned US vocalist Judy Niemack and US guitarist and composer Kurt Rosenwinkel. Fini graduated with a Masters in Music (voice and composition) in November 2009. Whilst in Berlin, Fini met and played with some inspiring young musicians, and went on to form a band with some of them; Manuel Schmiedel on piano, Andreas Lang on bass and Moritz Baumgaertner on drums. They played at various venues across Berlin and have recently played a couple of special dates in London in June 2010. Now back in the UK, Fini is working once more with her London based Quartet and recently recorded her debut album 'Step Up', due out late Spring 2011. The Quartet Featuring some of London's finest young musicians, the band includes Rick Simpson on piano (Martin Speake), Tom Farmer on bass (Empirical), and Josh Morrison on drums (Round Trip). They formed in late 2007 to play predominantly the compositions of Fini, alongside arrangements of standards and contemporary songs. With a dizzying range of influences from Wayne Shorter to Gretchen Parlato and John Taylor, Fini strives to write songs that reflect her own experiences, both tongue in cheek and with frank honesty. With and without text, poetry settings and original words, this music explores various corners of contemporary music, citing Brazilian and South American influences alongside Western Classical traditions, modern jazz and popular music. Other influences Kurt Elling, Joao Gilberto, Elmo Hope, Q-Tip, Raphael Saadiq, Maria Schneider, Guillermo Klein, Eska Mtungwazi, James Taylor, Milton Nascimento, John Taylor, Donny Hathaway, Fly, The Invisible and Brad Mehldau..... Chagall, Emil Nolde, Monet, John Betjeman, Pablo Neruda, Rumi, Sappho, Dylan Thomas, Salman Rushdie, Fernando Pessoa... Giorgio Locatelli, Smitten Kitchen, and The Hummingbird Bakery. Credits and Quotes 'Fini Bearman's talent and creativity are evident from the moment she begins to sing. With her beautiful voice, contemporary style, and cutting-edge compositions, she raises the bar of excellence for young jazz singers.' - Judy Niemack, Jazz Singer 'A word of praise here for singer Bearman who adds both gravitas and emotion to the piece whilst dealing with what must be some pretty difficult stuff technically'-Ian Mann, www.thejazzmann.com (Review from Carlos Lopez Reals recent album release Mandorla)'An arresting voice'- www.jazzcds.co.uk 'An emergent young vocalist' - Chris May, www.allaboutjazz.com '...Sung with elegant assurance' - Chris Parker, The Vortex Jazz Club http://www.myspace.com/finibearman http://www.finibearman.co.uk TICKETS http://www.chapelarts.org/events/?regevent_action=register&amp;event_id=97&amp;name_of_event=Fini+Bearman WEBSITE http://www.chapelarts.org&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Join us at London's legendary live music venue, 100 Club and see The Crave with support including Skinny Machines, two of the most exciting emerging bands around.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Headliner The Crave have been on the road non stop for the last three years touring Europe and America with some of the worlds biggest bands such as Shinedown, 3 Doors Down, Theory Of A Deadman, Buckcherry, Daughtry, Lifehouse, and Flyleaf to name just a few, add to this two UK headline tours and festival slots at Download, Sonisphere and Rock Am Ring the guys have earned their place as one of the most exciting and hardest working bands around. Support from the fantastic Skinny Machines who are reminiscent of The Cure, if they had been crossbred with Biffy Clyro&#8217;s dirty guitars, &#8216;Skinny Machines' echo the night life of South London, producing a shimmering blend of poignant lyrics, heavy riffs and catchy melodies. Having supported the likes of The Kooks, The Zutons and The Maccabees, the trajectory of this band seems like a foregone conclusion. 100% musical satisfaction guaranteed....&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The duo met in the mid 90's and worked together on a Greatest Hits compilation which led to them hooking up and writing music together and they are still working away on what they call 'our ongoing musical experiment.'</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;2008 brought a new chapter in the musical relationship between Kiki and Carmelo. They have signed a deal with EMI and for the first time Kiki's albums recorded in the 70's on Elton John's Rocket Records have been re-mastered and released on CD. The 3 albums that Kiki and Carmelo have recorded together which highlight their special collaboration and adventurous musical direction are also in the shops on EMI records....&#8216;its great to walk into a record shop or go on line and see all our music made available&#8217;.... says Kiki......and with the help of EMI they are raising their profile with more regular TV and radio appearances. The duo met in the mid 90's and worked together on a Greatest Hits compilation which led to them hooking up and writing music together and they are still working away on what they call 'our ongoing musical experiment.' Live concerts are very important to them and in their unique acoustic guitar based show they bring together their original music with some of Kiki's known songs such as 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' and 'I've Got The Music In Me' as well as covers of songs by people like Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel to name but a few.....this mix brings the audience to a very intimate and spontaneous evening.....

  <short_description>90's Brit Grunge cult band Midway Still return for a headline show at the Underbelly, Hoxton Square. Support comes from Aussie band Bonfire Nights who warm up for their tour with Sons &amp; Daughters with this London show.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Midway Still released their debut single way back in 1991. Now they are back! Occasional gigs over the past few years, including a tour of Japan, have only increased interest in this lost cult band of a mini-generation of classic Brit Grunge/Noise Pop bands that include The Becketts and The Family Cat. Championed by Steve Lamacq at the time and signed to Fire Records amongst others, 2011 could be a perfect time, twenty years on, to check out this bands quality mix of Husker Du meets Beatles guitar pop. If you like Yuck, surely you&#8217;ll love Midway Still.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Like skimming across a pond on a sunny day in an old fashioned rowing boat, dangling your fingers in the water and unexpectedly having one of them bitten off by something just below the surface. "There may be a better way to start the show than with the storming Essex 4-piece The Penguin Party, but if there is I certainly can't think of it" - Tom Robinson, BBC 6 Music (Jun 2011) Check them out at: http://www.thepenguinparty&#8203;.co.uk/ www.myspace.com/penguinpar&#8203;tyband www.facebook.com/#!/group.&#8203;php?gid=248205235324 Plus support from - Bordeauxxx Beautiful Indie pop from not too far away.

Mentallica reproduce the tracks as Metallica have recorded them.

A compilation of the videos made from this first album also earned the band a gold video award. L.A.

</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Fresh on the UK folk scene, this 24 year-old Newfoundlander is bringing something very different to the stage &#8211; and people are stopping to listen. The Canadian songstress&#8217;s new album Wonder Wonder, to be released on September 27th, is a colourful collection of stories about people, seasons, mad scientists, books, heartbreak, and home &#8211; with a jar of bluebells and a healthy slathering of peanut butter thrown in for good measure. As the winner of the 2011 Universal Music Camp Songwriters competition, the 2011 Canadian Songwriters&#8217; Association AGM competition, and a finalist for this year&#8217;s Listening Room International and Copenhagen Songwriters Festival competitions, her music has received critical acclaim and international radio airplay. Ashley&#8217;s songs are vibrant yet warm; honest, intimate, and influenced by both contemporary alternative sounds and the traditional music of the fishing outports where she grew up. Her emotive vocals showcase newly refined pop-folk sensibilities and a poetic yet quirky lyrical style often compared to Laura Marling, Regina Spektor, and Joni Mitchell. &#8220;Pure, simple, clean, well-written, melodic, reaffirming and personable, if not always intimate. Her songs come naturally, like a clear river over rounded stones.&#8221; Robert Singerman, former agent of R.E.M. &amp; James Brown TICKETS http://www.chapelarts.org/events/?regevent_action=register&amp;event_id=114&amp;name_of_event=Ashley+Fayth WEBSITE http://www.chapelarts.org/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Yob
Dark Castle
Kongh
Dead Existence</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Yob Is a psych/doom metal band from Eugene, Oregon composed of Aaron Reiseberg, Travis Foster, and Mike Scheidt. A skull crushing almost spiritual live experience, that has to be seen/heard to be believed. YOB were THE highlight of the 2010 Roadburn Festival, both times! A rare appearance on these shores, don't miss the opportunity to see these guys at the Purple Turtle with such a stella lineup! Dark castle is an American doom metal band formed by guitarist&#8211;vocalist Stevie Floyd and drummer&#8211;vocalist Rob Shaffer in 2005. They released their first full-length album, Spirited Migration, in 2009. New album Surrender To All Life has pushed the band further into sonic excess and will surely be up there with the best albums of the year. dark castle summon the power to open minds and move mountains using only a guitar, a drum kit, two voices, two minds and a bottomless well of earth-shaking riffs. Kongh Kongh are a sludge/doom metal threepiece from Sweden. While many bands do heavy well, Kongh pull it off better than most. Incorporating styles that include everything from Neurosis' "Souls at Zero" to Opeth's "Deliverance". Also not a million miles from headliners Yob, Kongh offers listeners an opportunity to experience the best elements of doom, sludge, progressive, and atmospheric metal. The band is currently working on new material, preparing to record a third album later in 2011. Dead existence Play a blend of sludge, doom, hardcore and stoner rock but pull influences from every corner of extreme music. "They may have an occasional stoner bent, but Dead Existence's sludge-laden trawl carries a gut-punching heft, the riffs a show of ill-destined perseverance while the vocalists bereft, defiant barks start to take on emotional, cathartic hue, dragging us down to whatever purgatory spawned them"&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>1349</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;1349 rose from the ashes of Alvheim in 1997, counting Ravn (vocals &amp; drums), Tjalve (guitars), Seidemann (bass) and Balfori (guitars). Balfori quit shortly after due to musical divergence. In early &#8217;99 the band found Archaon whose speed and technique took their music to a new level of intensity and brutality. Come spring 2000, 1349 decided to record a new promo showcasing the new material, and Frost of Satyricon was asked to lay down the drum tracks to get the speed required. Holycaust Records offered them a deal and released the new promo as an eponymous MCD. By early 2001, the band felt they had enough killer songs for a full-length album &#8211; &#8220;Liberation&#8221;. Hearing this material, Frost was so impressed that he asked to join and became a permanent member of the band. Recorded and mixed at Gordon Studios, Liberation blended old school soundscapes with warp-speed hysteria. 1349 signed with Candlelight Records in 2003 and released their debut full-length album in April 2003, then marched unstoppably forwards with the following releases &#8220;Beyond the Apocalypse&#8221; in 2004 and &#8220;Hellfire&#8221; in 2005. Guitarist and founding member Tjalve left in 2006 to focus his musical efforts on his band Pantheon I. Four years after the release of &#8220;Hellfire&#8221;, 1349 decided to unleash a quite different monster upon the unsuspecting masses and &#8220;Revelations of the Black Flame&#8221; saw 1349 return to Studio Studio Nyhagen with Tom G. Warrior co-mixing the album along with Ravn. Released May 25th 2009 on Candlelight Records, Revelations&#8230; saw 1349 explore the slower, darker and more ambient side of black metal, while still retaining the spirit of aural hellfire. An even deeper darkness was added to the sphere of 1349&#8230;it became evident that from here, it was gonna get scary. 2010 was a year when 1349 really started to flex muscles. With new cooperation partner Indie Recordings as the chosen label, 1349 unleashed their latest aural assault DEMONOIR, filled to the brim with abyssic darkness and hellish energy. This release &#8211; by far their most brutal to this date &#8211; showed that the band had gotten capable at blending a deeper and more sinister darkness with extreme intensity and venomous aggression, another proof of the band&#8217;s innovative take on Black Metal. 2011 brings 1349 to places dark and strange; be warned, and be ready&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;18:45 Pre-Concert Talk: Black British Jazz and the Meaning of Music in the UK, where Dr. Jason Toynbee of the Open University discusses themes and issues from the research project, What Is Black British Jazz? If black musicians have always been a minority in the British jazz scene they have nevertheless contributed in important ways to the emergence of jazz in the UK. The talk illustrates why this contribution has been so extraordinary, and also what it means in a Britain where racism and multiculturalism still co-exist in an uneasy relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Ghost Brigade is a five-piece metal band from Jyv&#228;skyl&#228;</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Ghost Brigade is a five-piece metal band from Jyv&#228;skyl&#228;, Finland, formed in 2005. They have taken elements from melodic death metal, doom metal and progressive metal into their music. Wille Naukkarinen (guitars): &#8220;In Ghost Brigade, selling albums is not what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s about the feeling I get when I write a new song, which I only get when I know the song is good enough. The metaphor for that is &#8220;the fire&#8221;. That explains the title of the album. We are guided by fire.&#8221; A quote on their website states (by date of the debut release) &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing above or below us, no written word wise enough, just notes that carry the silent fire.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>London based electro band of the moment I Am A Camera headline Hoxton Underbelly.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;It was a chance meeting while escaping from the burning wreckages of their former incarnations &#8211; Ian and Francesca collided and sparked an idea for a new band. It grew and grew in more discussions over multiple drinks in Manchester&#8217;s dive bars and London&#8217;s clubs of disrepute. They were both over everything and wanted something more. Melancholy machines and hard beats. &#8220;With I Am A Camera we wanted to create a cold wall of sound as an emotional outlet for our deepest thoughts and musings&#8221; explains Francesca. Swapping their pet loves of Bow Wow Wow, Layfayette from True Blood, Astrid Kirchherr, Paisley Park and Arthur C Clarke clicked. &#8216;We&#8217;re the band who fell to Earth&#8217;. I Am A Camera was born in October 2010. They aim to sweep you off your feet.London based I AM A Camera&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;David Newton has an international reputation as a jazz pianist with a large number of albums to his name. Growing up in Renfrewshire, Scotland, he had a musical upbringing with the piano trio sound of Peterseon, Tatum or Garner played daily in his home. After graduating from Leeds Colege of Music in 1979, David teamed up with saxophonist Alan Barnes, moving to London where he rapidly became a much sought after pianist after playing with guitarist Martin Taylor and saxophonist Don Weller. Having recorded with Buddy de Franco and Martin Taylor, Newton and Barnes worked for 'Concorde Label' agent Barry Hatcher and made several recordings. Later in the 90's David made a reputation for himself as an accompanist for singers Tina May, Claire Martin and Stacey Kent, with whom he spent the next ten years recording and travelling all over the world. The recent CD 'Portrait of a Woman' establishes a new musical freedom for the Trio with David leading as arranger and composer. He was voted the best jazz pianist in the British Jazz Awards for the 8th time in 2008 and was made a Fellow of Leeds College of Music in 2003. "There is always more to Newton's playing than first meets the ear. The surface may be smooth, but there are all kinds of clever, subtle things going on beneath" - Dave Gelly, The Observer. "Fantastic mainstream pianist who plays with wit and grace, as well as swinging like the clappers.." - Time Out. Joining David for this special event at the Cavern will be Marianne Windham (bass) and Ed Williams (drums).&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Steve Tilston is one of this country&#8217;s greatest song-writers with many of his songs considered modern folk-song classics and covered by the likes of Fairport Convention, Dolores Keane, John Wright and others.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Farncombe Cavern is pleased to welcome back Steve Tilston, who performed here last on the on the 13th June 2010. The writer of the classic songs &#8220;The Slip Jigs and Reels&#8221;, &#8220;The Naked Highwayman&#8221;, and &#8220;Here&#8217;s to Tom Paine&#8221; has a new album out on Hubris Records. Entitled Ziggurat, hear Tilston deftly weave his mastery on a dozen new insightful songs of love, loss, war and gold, plus the reworking of a couple of gems from the tradition; with special guest musicians Dave Bowie, Chris Parkinson, Richard Curran, Fin McArdle and Maggie Boyle. Steve Tilston is one of this country&#8217;s greatest song-writers with many of his songs considered modern folk-song classics and covered by the likes of Fairport Convention, Dolores Keane, John Wright and others. He&#8217;s also renowned for the way he takes a favourite traditional &#8220;old chestnut&#8221; and makes it his own. His career was marked last year by the release of Reaching Back a 5-CD boxed-set retrospective. Not one to stand still though and with &#8220;Madame Muse&#8221; on his heels, Steve is &#8220;reaching forward&#8221; with this new collection. Born in Liverpool and raised in the Midlands, Steve has been quietly ploughing his own artistic furrow, turning out quality albums since the early 70s; again it has born fruit with the masterful new album. In the past he has toured as guitarist with Ballet Rambert, as a member of Ship of Fools, with John Renbourn and more recently with WAZ! He is a celebrated artist both in Britain and abroad, winning accolades in Europe, Australia and the USA, where &#8220;Here&#8217;s to Tom Paine,&#8221; has been chosen as the theme song for the Tom Paine society of America. Steve is one of the most engaging performers on the scene today. &#8220;&#8230;in better form than I&#8217;ve ever heard him.&#8221; - Mike Harding, BBC Radio 2 &#8220;Gently intoxicating and uplifting stuff&#8221; - MoJo Magazine, UK &#8220;His music has a flow and poignancy which makes it stand out from the plethora of singer-songwriters on the scene&#8221; - Guitar Magazine USA &#8220;Steve is of that rare breed of singer, songwriter and guitarist who actually excels in all departments&#8221; - Froots Magazine, UK &#8220;His songs are at once familiar, yet objects of wonder&#8221; - Rhythms, Aus&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>While She Sleeps + Bury Tomorrow

The band has grown together and moulded into a top metal act that have always seemed to steal the show with their crazy live performances. That is hard for anyone to deny.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;There is a spark of excitement at a While She Sleeps show. This band certainly gets the crowd on their feet, moving their heads and slamming their body&#8217;s into each other while appreciating the heavy Steel City act. They&#8217;ve been great support for big time bands such as &#8216;Enter Shikari&#8217; and &#8216;Bury Tomorrow&#8217;, along with many more. From seeing my first While She Sleeps gig (Abbreviated to being, WSS), I have witnessed a huge difference in how they play, the energy that they show on stage, and their bond as a band. Individually, they work their asses off 100% and now it&#8217;s paying off. They are playing shows at many cities in the UK, as well as in Belgium, too! The band has grown together and moulded into a top metal act that have always seemed to steal the show with their crazy live performances. That is hard for anyone to deny. Their numerous own written songs have gone down very well with their drastically growing fan-base, and nothing but praise and admiration goes out to them. With songs like &#8216;I Am King&#8217; and &#8216;Gepetto&#8217; along with many more addictive sounds, it pleases and excites me for what is coming next. Catchy metal riffs and heavy fast beats mixed with a great stage performance are sure to be on the agenda. They have recently had a change in vocalist, not through a fall-out, but through having a good enough relationship to decide what is best for the band. A new front-man may be a great move for the Steel City metalers, so they can pursue in making even better songs and giving their fans music that is unique, with ex Revenance vocalist, Lawrence Taylor. The future looks bright for this great bunch of lads, with an EP on the way and a tour in December with Ignominious Incarceration; you should get down to a show and find out for yourself how exciting they are!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;A live music club night where you get to hear the hottest unsigned bands and artists around with an open mic at the start of the night! The Subajah Family are an urban soul reggae band who have built a mystical, soulful and poetic sound around unique melodies. The Staves are three sisters who blend their distinctive voices into beautiful, spell-binding harmonies, singing their delicately crafted songs with a folk-twist here, a nod to Americana there, and a distinctly British sound. Our headline act, Riker Maneuver are a great four piece with songs ranging from a blast of musical noise to a quiet storm and back again. Live performances are full of energy and comic genius.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;V2A &#8211; The &#8220;CyberElectro&#8221; stars V2A are headlining the festival! Their latest album &#8220;Machine Corps&#8221; has been praised as one of the best album in the Electro-EBM-Industrial genre. &#8220;Machine Corps&#8220; &#8211; the third release of the British-German project V2A is the best and even harshest album the band has ever created. With their first two albums &#8220;EBM&#8221; (Trisol) and &#8220;Mechanized Infantry&#8221; (Biohazzard) V2A became famous for their distinctive way to mix CyberElectro, EBM and Industrial. &#8220;Machine Corps&#8220; goes one step further &#8211; it is both more mature and even deeper than its predecessors. Techno-like vocals meet pumping bass lines and atmospheric soundscapes. Masterminds Kevin Steward and Ines Lehmann created a new electronic masterpiece &#8211; tracks like &#8220;Electro ueber alles&#8221; and &#8220;Cannibal Clan&#8221; will surely become the new Electro-hymns in your local club. www.v2a.co.uk METHOD CELL "Method Cell have certainly made their manifesto known on their debut effort, and may have just come up with the best EBM album of the year so far" (NXLive Magazine). www.methodcell.com&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The two voices are a natural mix, music from the soul, delivered with powerful conviction by a duo in the truest sense of that word. Their live shows encapsulate a blend of skill and powerful emotion. The commitment from both artists to put the songs first, is manifest and their willingness to work for each other on stage is inspirational. You haven't heard a duo until you've heard this one! Johnny and Mike first met Penzance in the early seventies. Since then their paths have seldom crossed but a chance phone call in late 2004 generated the idea of them playing music together. The two voices are a natural mix and the way they share the songs shows this to be a duo in the truest sense. The combination of Johnny's piano and Mike's guitar gets right to the heart of the listener. This is music from the soul, delivered with powerful conviction by a duo in the truest sense of that word. The delight they take in playing the music is plain to see and their live shows encapsulate a blend of skill and powerful emotion. The commitment from both artists to put the songs first, is manifest and their willingness to work for each other on stage is inspirational. Their first duo album released a couple of years ago, Breaking the Silence, Faymus Recordings FRCD 0101, is collection of 15 songs with an unlisted surprise track. With this recording the duo displays their ability to write together, perform cover versions by other writers as well as enhance the arrangements of each other's compositions. It's the real deal, the complete package. Johnny Coppin &#8220;One of the finest voices&#8221; - Q Magazine. &#8220;Johnny Coppin is one of my favourite singers and songwriters and playing music with him is a joy and a pleasure&#8221; - Mike Silver. Johnny began in the 1970's as one of the founders of the folk-rock band Decameron. Since the band's break-up in 1976, he has pursued a solo career playing arts centres and festivals in Europe and beyond. Johnny has recorded over a dozen albums and these include, Edge of Day with poet Laurie Lee, an album of Gloucestershire songs and three Christmas CDs, while his 2005 album, The Winding Stair, has been receiving excellent reviews. Mike Silver &#8220;Hidden gem. Now the secret is out&#8221; &#8211; Bob Harris. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a big fan of Mike Silver and his songs for years so it&#8217;s such an honour and delight to be touring together&#8221; - Johnny Coppin Emerging in the 1970's, Mike was one of the first signings to Elton John's Rocket Records. Since moving on from Rocket, he has played festivals, clubs and arts centres all over Europe and released a good number of albums in the process. In July 2003, Mike's song, &#8220;Not a Matter of Pride&#8221;, from his album Solid Silver was added to the play lists of no less than 36 local radio stations up and down the UK and was given extensive rotation on BBC Radio 2 on Terry Wogan's early morning programme.

With some of their first songs penned about being young and Black in the UK, they were highly relevant to the cultural climate of the time. However, Aswad are best known for hits such as &#8220;Don&#8217;t Turn Around&#8221; and &#8220;Shine,&#8221; which stormed the charts in the eighties and nineties. Aswad are a stand-out feature of eighties pop culture and a fantastic live band &#8211; now part of the decade&#8217;s big revival!

  <short_description>Paul Curreri is a renowned American singer/songwriter making a rare appearance in the UK.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Paul Curreri is renowned for his inspired songs, bright voice, and talented finger style playing. Described by WTJU&#8217;s Aer Stephen as &#8220;a ruffled gypsy gutter cowboy, a true life adventurer, a bright new voice&#8221;, he has also been compared to Martin Sexton because of his reputation for inspired live performances. Raised in Richmond, Virginia, Paul now makes his home in Charlottesville with songwriter/guitarist Devon Sproule and his sixth album, &#8216;California&#8217;, was released in the UK on Tin Angel Records in 2010. Recorded after Paul recovered from a serious throat injury, this pivotal experience inspired an outpouring of his most meditative and musically diverse material to date, a record that marries the shambling roots rock-edginess of previous album &#8216;Velvet Rut&#8217; with the finger-picked country blues of earlier efforts like &#8216;From Long Gones To Hawkesmoth&#8217;. It&#8217;s a joyous step forward in Curreri&#8217;s burgeoning career &#8220;5 STARS&#8230; With his instinctive, sensual gift for melody, Curreri&#8217;s songs are saturated in colour and feeling, the sonic equivalent of William Eggleston&#8217;s photography.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;New-York-based singer and guitarist, Will Scott blends soulful Americana and hill country blues, delivered with a voice that The New York Press describes as &#8220;thick as blood.&#8221; Scott&#8217;s live performances are known as some of the best in the industry (Twisted South). Americana UK calls him &#8220;one of the most impressive new acts of his kind to come along in quite some time.&#8221; His 2009 release, Gnawbone, continues to receive praise in the US and Europe and was a finalist for &#8220;Best Blues Album&#8221; at the Independent Music Awards. Scott is presently touring in support of a new recording, "Keystone Crossing." UK dates include a return to Glastonbury Festival and a debut at Maverick Festival.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>'The Voice of Istanbul' returns to the Royal Albert Hall following her first appearance here in 2007</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Ranked amongst the world's best alongside Billie Holliday, Freddie Mercury, and Placido Domingo in a recent 50 Great Voices series (United States National Public Radio), Sezen Aksu is a diva whose inimitable voice touches deep into human soul whether or not one understands the Turkish of her deeply poetic lyrics. "Sezen's voice is in possession of a remarkable gift: a voice which rings true with each gorgeously stunning note" Goran Bregovic Since starting her singing career over 30 years ago she has penned over 500 songs, from fragile ballads to raucous, hip-shaking dance music. Her songs speak of love, but don't shy from social and political issues, earning her a place on Songlines Magazine's list of World Music Rebels alongside Manu Chao and Bob Marley. Drawing on Turkish folk and even Ottoman Classical traditions, her songs have a unique signature that blends oriental roots with contemporary pop. Her song &#350;&#305;mar&#305;k, known more famously as Tarkan's Kiss Kiss song, became an international hit in many languages. Her new band, led by Grammy-nominated pianist and composer Fahir Atako&#287;lu and featuring highly respected percussionist Jarrod Cagwin and Dutch bassist Eric van der Westen alongside Turkish master musicians Mustafa Bozt&#252;y (percussion), G&#246;ksun &#199;avdar (clarinet), Fatih Ah&#305;skal&#305; (Guitar and Cumbus), &#214;zer Arkun (Cello) and Nurcan Eren, Sezen's long-standing backing vocalist, will perform her best-loved songs with fresh style. "Sezen Aksu is the voice of Turkish pop, an altogether superior brand compared with its Western counterparts" Michael Church, The Independent&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Led by fiery saxophonist and award-winning composer Gilad Atzmon, The Orient House Ensemble was founded in London in 2000 and is renowned as one of the world&#8217;s most brilliant and inspirational jazz groups.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Gilad will be giving a talk at 6.30pm (see MORE for details) Music performance starts 8.00 pm. The Tide has Changed, The Orient House Ensemble 10th Anniversary Tour. Gilad Atzmon - alto &amp; soprano saxophone and clarinet Frank Harrison &#8211; piano Yaron Stavi - double bass Eddie Hick - drums Led by fiery saxophonist and award-winning composer Gilad Atzmon, The Orient House Ensemble was founded in London in 2000 and is renowned as one of the world&#8217;s most brilliant and inspirational jazz groups. Gilad' s New Book: The Wandering Who? will be out in October, read more below, it is already available to pre-order on Amazon.co.uk The Road To Bop - Ahead of his concert, Gilad will give a talk about his first encounter with Jazz music and its impact on his ethical and philosophical stand. The talk will explore different aspects of music and their direct link with Gilad&#8217;s views on morality. Drawing on the music of Coltrane and Bird as well as the beautiful music of the Middle East to create something new and wonderful the Ensemble has been touring constantly all over Europe and the UK and recorded six albums to date, have won many awards and received constant worldwide critical acclaim. The musical history of the OHE is a story of a relentless attempt to cross the divide, blending East and West and forming a new improvisational language out of Jazz and ethic music. For Atzmon, artistic freedom is the true meaning of cultural resistance. He insists that this is the exact quality that transformed Black American music from beauty into spirit. For Atzmon the true meaning of being a musician is a constant attempt to keep reminding yourself why you decided to play music in the first place. Though the Ensemble blends many musical ideas and styles it is always within the Jazz idiom: the energy, the subliminal communication, the poetic pain and ecstatic laughter. The Orient House Ensemble is there to keep Jazz as a spirit of resistance: a struggle against musical stagnation and oppression of any kind. Press Quotes: "A formidable improvisational array...a local jazz giant steadily drawing himself up to his full height..." John Fordham, The Guardian &#8220;&#8230;Atzmon is an astonishing musician.&#8221; John Lewis, Metro, September 07 "An avid Charlie Parker disciple..." Evening Standard March 2009 "Atzmon is surely the hardest-gigging man in British jazz..." The Times "Atzmon is a loose cannon: a larger than life figure with an almost overpowering musical personality... it's as perfect a jazz marriage as you could wish for" Phil Johnson, Independent on Sunday &#8220;Atzmon sends his soprano sax and clarinet soaring over complex rhythms from all points of the globe with a poetry that never forfeits control.&#8221;- Nina Caplan, Metro "His flow of ideas and coherent marshalling of them makes for solos that are as exhilarating as they are impassioned fantastiK" The Herald Sunday Tribune Gilad's new book launches in October THE WANDERING WHO? A Study of Jewish Identity Politics by Gilad Atzmon &#8216;A transformative story told with unflinching integrity that all (especially Jews) who care about real peace, as well as their own identity, should not only read, but reflect upon and discuss widely.&#8217; Richard Falk &#8216;Atzmon has the courage - so profoundly lacking among Western intellectuals&#8217; James Petras BACK COVER TEXT: Jewish identity is tied up with some of today&#8217;s most difficult and contentious issues. The purpose of this book is to open up many of these issues for discussion. It examines Jewish identity politics and Jewish contemporary ideology using both popular culture and scholarly texts. Since Israel defines itself openly as the &#8216;Jewish State&#8217;, we should ask what the notions of Judaism, Jewishness, Jewish culture and Jewish ideology stand for. Atzmon analyses secular Jewish political and cultural discourse, both Zionist and anti Zionist. He looks at the Jewish political attitude towards history and time, the role of the holocaust, anti-gentile ideologies, Jewish pressure groups, Zionist lobbying and more. The current state of world affairs raises an urgent need for a change in our attitudes towards politics, identity politics and history. Gilad Atzmon is an internationally acclaimed jazz saxophonist and composer, a member of the Blockheads, and fronts the Orient House Ensemble. His two novels Guide to the Perplexed and My One and Only Love as well as his political and cultural essays are published widely in many languages. He lives in London. Endorsements: &#8216;Gilad Atzmon has written an absorbing and moving account of his journey from hard core Israeli nationalist to a de-Zionized patriot of humanity and passionate advocate of justice for the Palestinian people. It is a transformative story told with unflinching integrity that all (especially Jews) who care about real peace, as well as their own identity, should not only read, but reflect upon and discuss widely.&#8217; Professor Richard Falk, Albert G. Milbank Professor of International Law Emeritus, Princeton University, author of over 20 books, and UN Special Rapporteur for Occupied Palestinian Territories. &#8216;Gilad Atzmon has written a fascinating and provocative book on Jewish identity in the modern world. He shows how assimilation and liberalism are making it increasingly difficult for Jews in the Diaspora to maintain a powerful sense of their 'Jewishness.' Panicked Jewish leaders, he argues, have turned to Zionism (blind loyalty to Israel) and scaremongering (the threat of another Holocaust) to keep the tribe united and distinct from the surrounding goyim. As Atzmon&#8217;s own case demonstrates, this strategy is not working and is causing many Jews great anguish. The Wandering Who? should be widely read by Jews and non-Jews alike.&#8217; John J. Mearsheimer is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago &#8216;Gilad Atzmon&#8217;s book, The Wandering Who? is as witty and thought provoking as its title. But it is also an important book, presenting conclusions about Jews, Jewishness and Judaism which some will find shocking but which are essential to an understanding of Jewish identity politics and the role they play on the world stage.&#8217; Karl Sabbagh is a journalist, television producer and the author of several books including A Rum Affair, Power Into Art, Dr Riemann&#8217;s Zeros and Palestine: A Personal History. He is currently the publisher of Hesperus Press &#8216;Gilad Atzmon&#8216;s The Wandering Who? is a series of brilliant illuminations and critical reflections on Jewish ethnocentrism and the hypocrisy of those who speak in the name of universal values and act tribal. Relying on autobiographical and existential experiences, as well as intimate observations of everyday life, both informed by profound psychological insights, Atzmon does what many critics of Israel fail to do; he uncovers the links between Jewish identity politics in the Diaspora with their ardent support for the oppressive policies of the Israeli state. Atzmon provides deep insights into &#8220;neo-ghetto&#8221; politics. He has the courage - so profoundly lacking among western intellectuals - to speak truth to the power of highly placed and affluent Zionists who shape the agendas of war and peace in the English-speaking world. With wit and imagination, Atzmon&#8217;s passionate confrontation with neo-conservative power grabbers and liberal yea sayers sets this book apart for its original understanding of the dangers of closed minds with hands on the levers of power. This book is more than a &#8220;study of Jewish identity politics&#8221; insofar as we are dealing with a matrix of power that affects all who cherish self-determination and personal freedom in the face of imperial and colonial dictates.&#8217; Professor James Petras, Bartle Professor of Sociology at Binghamton University, New York, author of more than 62 books including The Power of Israel in the United States. &#8216;Atzmon&#8217;s insight into the organism created by the Zionist movement is explosive. The Wandering Who? tears the veil off of Israel&#8217;s apparent civility, its apparent friendship with the United States, and its expressed solicitude for Western powers, exposing beneath the assassin ready to slay any and all that interfere with its tribal focused ends.&#8217; Professor William A. Cook, Professor of English at the University of La Verne in southern California, and author of The Rape Of Palestine. &#8216;The Wandering Who? features Gilad Atzmon at his delightful and insightful best: engaging, provocative and persuasive.&#8217; Jeff Gates, author of Guilt By Association: How Deception and Self-Deceit Took America to War &#8216;The Wandering Who? is a pioneering work that deserves to be read and Gilad Atzmon is brave to write this book!&#8217; Dr. Samir Abed-Rabbo, author and Professor Emeritus in the field of international law. He is director of the Center for Arabic and Islamic Studies in Brattleboro, Vermont and the former Dean of The Jerusalem School for Law and Diplomacy.

  <short_description>One of the leading exponents of modern shoegaze music SPOTLIGHT KID from Nottingham celebrate a triumphant Glastonbury Festival appearance with a show at the Hoxton Underbelly, London as part of their UK tour on Friday 21st October 2011.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Spotlight Kid&#8216;s music draws influences from the likes of My Bloody Valentine, Spacemen 3, Lush and Swervedriver. It features mixtures of Krautrock and 90s psychedelic rock. With shimmering guitars and ethereal vocals, they take the building blocks of your favourite shoegaze bands and create something refreshing. The first album Departure was released on Club AC30. In 2009 Spotlight Kid released Crystal Dreams, a four track EP, released on Two &amp; One Records. In 2010 they followed this with a limited edition 7&#8243; vinyl double A-Side &#8220;April/All is Real&#8221; on Club AC30. The band have recently finished recording their new album and it&#8217;s expected to be released in September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Seven of the exciting young folk scene&#8217;s finest musicians unleash their duelling fiddles, soaring brass crescendos, wind and vocal harmonies and earth shattering grooves in a genre busting live show that will take your breath away.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Harnessing energy from the elements and inspiration from their unstoppable sense of adventure, seven of the exciting young folk scene&#8217;s finest musicians unleash their duelling fiddles, soaring brass crescendos, wind and vocal harmonies and earth shattering grooves in a genre busting live show that will take your breath away. "Truly exciting, awe inspiring music from a band who can only be heading for the top floor." &#8211; Songlines Championed by BBC Radio 2's Bob Harris, The Old Dance School's evocative images, blistering tunes and vivid songs are performed with electric vitality, at the heart of which; close friends with a clear vision and an unhindered ear for a good melody. "Classical quality, jazz imagination, folk sensibility, rock/roots energy...Masterful." &#8211; Scotsman The Old Dance School began in 2006 as a gathering of friends in the garden of the old Betty Fox school of ballet in Birmingham, then legendary party venue, from where they take their name. From here, each would bring along a tune or a song for the group to experiment with culminating in their 2008 debut 'Based On A True Story', produced by Joe Broughton. "Timeless...Highly evocative...indescribably beautiful." &#8211; Bright Young Folk Four years, 40,000 miles, many dozen festivals, and several trips to A &amp; E later, 2010's breakthrough album 'Forecast' delivers a startling take on contemporary folk that is both firmly-rooted and unashamedly forward-thinking. With legendary producer Calum Malcolm at the helm, The Old Dance School's second release was recorded in an intense period nested in the mountains of Snowdonia, landing rave reviews across the board and nominations for Spiral Earth's Best Original Song and The Hancock's best newcomer. "Abundantly creative...energetic, fresh and supremely innovative" &#8211; Living Tradition The seven members of The Old Dance School may seem fresh faced, but don't let them fool you, the diversity and scale of each one's musical journey is quite remarkable. From international jazz festivals to European opera tours, film score commissions to classical recitals, green festivals to tattoo conventions, members of The Old Dance School have performed, recorded and toured with artists such as Martha Wainwright, Cerys Matthews, Graham Coxon, Zoe Rahman, Neil Yates, Jim Perrin, The Destroyers, Martha Tilston, Kevin Dempsey, Joe Broughton and Chris While. They are currently working on their third album. "Really hits the mark; there's a genuine creative fizz to what the band do." &#8211; Mike Harding, BBC Radio 2 "An absolute gem&#8230;Wonderful!" &#8211; Bob Harris, BBC Radio 2 TICKETS http://www.chapelarts.org/events/?regevent_action=register&amp;event_id=99&amp;name_of_event=The+Old+Dance+School WEBSITE http://www.chapelarts.org/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Jim is best known for his three Top 5 hits. The first was "I Won't Let You Down" (1982), as the lead singer in the trio Ph.D., with Tony Hymas and Simon Phillips. His solo performance, "I Should Have Known Better", was a United Kingdom number one in 1984. The third track was the theme song from Boon, "Hi Ho Silver" which reached Number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in 1986. He has also featured as a vocalist on the charity No.1s "You'll Never Walk Alone" with The Crowd and "Let It Be" with Ferry Aid. He started his music career at the young age of 15 with his own band, The Method. At age 16, he also fronted a Glasgow band called Jade. That lineup included bassist Chris Glen who went on to play with "The Sensational Alex Harvey Band" and Jim Lacey on lead guitar who later went on to join The Alan Bown! Jade played many pub, club and college gigs in London in 1969, playing at Brunel University, West London College in Cricklewood, The Pied Bull in Islington, West Hampstead Country Club, another college in Virginia Water and many more in 1969. They also supported The Move on their Scottish tour with The Stoics in the same year. Jim was discovered by Alexis Korner. He spent the next couple of years as part of Korner's band. He provided additional and backing vocals on many of Korner's songs. Most of which would appear on The Lost Album. In 1976 Diamond left Korner to form Bandit. The line-up included AC/DC band member Cliff Williams. They were soon signed up by Arista Records and released their d&#233;but album, Bandit. They failed to reach the chart. In 1979 Diamond was lead vocalist for a Japanese band called BACCO. In recent years, Diamond has teamed up with saxophonist Chris "Snake" Davis, who is known for his work with soul outfit, M People. The pair where known as The Blue Shoes, but more recently have been billed as Jim Diamond and Snake Davis. In 2005, Diamond released his first studio album in eleven years. Souled and Healed also gave Diamond the single releases "When You Turn" and "Blue Shoes". This performance at the Cavern will be an intimate, up close performance enhancing what will be an excellent evening for fan's young &amp; old.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;A veritable overnight sensation at the age of 56, televised appearances at the Albert Hall at the first ever Folk Prom, and on Later with Jools. Martin Simpson will be releasing a new album in 2011 and judging by last year's truly brilliant 'True Stories' it should be something to look forward to. Ash Keys Music presents folk guitar legend Martin Simpson. In the last two years, Martin Simpson has been busier, more successful and more visible than ever before in his 37 year career, a veritable overnight sensation at the age of 56. Televised appearances at the Albert Hall at the first ever Folk Prom, and on Later with Jools, and radio appearances with Aled Jones, Mike Harding and Simon Mayo amongst others, garnered extraordinarily good reactions. Numerous festival appearances and a series of almost completely sold out UK tours continued to raise his profile. His 2007 release, &#8216;Prodigal Son&#8217; was nominated for 5 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, and won Album of the Year, and Best Original song for the deeply moving &#8216;Never Any Good&#8217;. At the end of 2008, Simpson returned to the States for the first time in 5 years for a triumphant series of gigs. Having lived and worked in the US for 14 years he is regarded there as a guitar legend, and an enormously influential musician.

  <short_description>Doom over London #2
all day metal!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Saturnus (DK) Saturnus is a band from Copenhagen, Denmark formed in 1991 playing melodic death/doom metal, with touches of gothic metal. They sing of sorrow, loss, and death. They're known for switching between 3 vocal styles - clean, growled and recitation. More info: www.myspace.com/saturnus Esoteric (UK) Dark, innovative music that was evocative to and expressive of the contents of their psyche. The lyrics and music are reflections and transpositions of their thoughts, philosophies, emotions and experiences. The music captures the essence of the word 'esoteric'. More info: http://www.esotericuk.net/ http://www.myspace.com/eso&#8203;tericuk The prophecy (UK) More info: http://www.the-prophecy.ne&#8203;t/ http://www.myspace.com/the&#8203;prophecyeng Decemberance (GR) Solid Doom/Death metal with extreme musical explosions combined with psychedelic - horror soundscapes and "mass manipulative" visuals..Inner Hell...growls...screams...&#8203;Ancient Pink floyd...early My Dying Bride... More info: www.youtube.com/user/decem&#8203;berance www.myspace.com/decemberan&#8203;ce Ophis (DE) Ophis [greek: snake] converge monolithic, depressive and nihilistic Doom Metal with pieces of raw, aggressive old school Death Metal as an outlet for its members&#8217; very own negative emotions. Rooted in the musical vein of the early 90s, Ophis&#8217; music yet maintains an undeniable actuality and an authentic atmosphere of despair and rage, far beyond any mainstream or commercial approach. More info: http://www.ophisdoom.de/ My silent wake(UK) Described as gothic death doom, although it also includes more varied elements. Their influences are wide ranging but predominantly include early Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, Trouble, Celtic Frost and of course Black Sabbath. More info: http://www.mysilentwake.co&#8203;.uk/mswmusic.htm dead existence (UK) "They may have an occasional stoner bent, but Dead Existence's sludge-laden trawl carries a gut-punching heft, the riffs a show of ill-destined perseverance while the vocalists bereft, defiant barks start to take on emotional, cathartic hue, dragging us down to whatever purgatory spawned them" Metal Hammer Magazine More info: http://www.deadexistence.n&#8203;et/ eye of solitude (UK) The music is inspired by emotional distress, inner pain and a cruel combination of negativity and grief. Dark shapes that terrorize the soul and keep it captive on the altar of suffering, until when not being able to breathe any longer, it finds its end - a supreme escape towards peace and eternal rest. More info: http://www.myspace.com/eye&#8203;ofsolitude&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>With a name evoking images of frozen landscapes and endless blue skies, Essex-based quartet The Floe, are set to take their stunning songs and stage performance on the road.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;With a name evoking images of frozen landscapes and endless blue skies, Essex-based quartet The Floe, are set to take their stunning songs and stage performance on the road. Within the group there is an alchemy that makes their sound both distinctive and compelling. Brimming with tales of love, heartache, longing and hope, The Floe's music is built on a solid foundation of delicate melodies, soaring vocals &amp; passionate lyrics that melt the heart. At the heart of The Floe is guitarist &amp; songwriter David Booth. A native of the Peak District, Dave moved to Essex in 1998 to further his solo career. He soon secured himself a deal with a small record label and recorded an album. However, David's days as a solo artist proved to be short-lived after meeting a female vocalist who was destined to become his songwriting soul mate&#8230; Sarah Springett had heard some of David&#8217;s solo material via a friend, and liked what she&#8217;d heard so much she tracked David down at one of his gigs so she could personally hand him a copy of the demo she'd just recorded. Impressed by both Sarah's demo and her "make-it-happen" attitude, David arranged for the pair to meet up and, when they did, it was clear that they shared a genuine musical chemistry. Any reservations Dave had about shelving his solo career were instantly dispelled. Deciding to form a band together, Sarah and David recruited drummer Simon Edgoose, whose production expertise has since enabled The Floe to fully realise the potential of their songs in the studio, developing the band's expansive sound during the recording process.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Artery Foundation Across The Nation Tour 2011

Featuring:
Miss May I
Chelsea Grin
Abandon All Ships
Chunk! No, Captain Chunk</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Ohio metallers MISS MAY I will be making a very welcome return to Europe this October for their first headline tour! Having successfully stormed through the UK in both December 2010 and April 2011 supporting Asking Alexandria and We Came As Romans respectively, the band have been going from strength to strength, with their latest outing taking them to Australia as main support to Parkway Drive. They will also be re-releasing a deluxe CD and DVD version of &#8216;Monument&#8217; featuring 3 new studio tracks, 1 B-side and a DVD with all of the bands music videos, live concert footage, interviews and more out 4th July 2011 on Rise Records. This reissue touches upon parts of thrash merged with heavy metalcore breakdowns, but remains well balanced with great melody. The intensity on &#8216;Monument&#8217; is unmatched by any metal release this year, and all that emotion will be unhinged live this summer on the Vans 2011 Warped Tour. This is a must for any existing Miss May I fan, and a perfect introduction for the scores of new fans they&#8217;re gaining daily.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Set to release their new album &#8216;Five serpents Teeth&#8217; through Earache records on September 26th. The band will have a whole albums worth of new material to play in addition to material from their critically acclaimed efforts All Hallows Eve, Enter The Grave and infected nations. There are very few bands around that can still play thrash metal how it was meant to be played. Luckily for the UK Evile are one of them &#8211; this is a show you do NOT want to miss out on!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Mani&#232;re des Boh&#233;miens play improvised Django Reinhardt, Stephane Grappelli influenced Gypsy Jazz and Eastern European swing. They are the most debauched, ecstatic and downright amazing live band you will have seen for a long while. Gypsy jazz played with the jaunty abandon of a misspent youth, an abusive PE teacher and a broken heart and arranged for 6 young virtuoso musicians who travel around playing the violin, guitar, double bass and accordion whilst dipping in and out of Parisian alleyways and eastern European brothels, absorbing pieces of the colourful lives they meet along the way.Rob: A battle-hardened warrior violinist. A highly competent fiddler with the enthusiasm of a child in a sweet shop. His fingers live in different time zones. Mark: A man of the bass. A virile,strong, hunter with the nimble fingers of a third-world sweat shop employee. Matt: A small and vigorous guitarist. He has been blessed with the power of telepathy and can control the guitar with his mind. You may never see him touch it. Jonny: A accordion player with the grace of a master sculpture. Elliott: A guitarist and a man of the land. A sower of melodic seeds and a rhythmic powerhouse with the delicate touch of a virgin masseuse. Roger: A young and passionate guitarist. Totally blind. They've been played on 6 music several times and have been included on Tom Robinson's 'best of Introducing' podcast. April review in Leftlion: 'For one night only in our fair city of Nottingham, I was temporarily transported to a basement bar in a Parisien ghetto when I went to see Maniere Des Bohemiens at the Cafe Bar Contemporary. Inspired by the likes of Django Reinhardt and Duke Ellington, Maniere Des Bohemiens have jazz in their blood and gypsy fire in their soul, producing improvised gypsy swing that is as passionate as it is skillfully played, which was truly exhilarating.'

  <short_description>Side One Dummy Records' The Rev. Peyton's Big Damn Band play an exclusive London date @ Cargo. Expect a highly energetic show, mixing Blues, Country, Rockabilly, Folk and Punk.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Reverend Peyton&#8217;s Big Damn Band actually isn&#8217;t that big. It&#8217;s kinda like your husky pal everyone calls &#8220;Tiny.&#8221; The young, modest three-piece from Indianapolis makes up for its size deficiency with a high-energy sound steeped in classic Blues tradition. With just acoustic guitar, the occasional dobro, a minimal drum kit and the always reliable washboard, the trio concocts a rousing, hyper and authentic brand of Blues that sounds like what might come out of that secret meth lab nestled deep in the backwaters of the Mississippi delta. But the pumping adrenaline doesn&#8217;t take anything away from the trio&#8217;s virtuosic grasp on the genre. The Rev. Peyton has a stirring voice dripping with the hallowed, life-worn distinctiveness of the masters, while brother Jayme Peyton (drums) and The Rev&#8217;s wife, &#8220;Washboard&#8221; Breezy, stir up a tornadic rhythmic whirl (the Rev&#8217;s acoustic guitar work is as equally frenetic and skilled). See, size doesn&#8217;t matter, especially when it comes to from-the-soul, gutbucket Blues music.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>A night of celebration of the late great John Peel with DJ's playing tracks from his favourite bands and Peel Sessions plus live sets from legendary punk/indie bands Vic Godard &amp; Subway Sect, Viv Albertine (The Slits) and Television Personalities.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;A night of celebration of the late great John Peel with DJ's playing tracks from his favourite bands and Peel Sessions plus live sets from legendary punk/indie bands Vic Godard &amp; Subway Sect, Viv Albertine (The Slits) and Television Personalities. Vic Godard &amp; Subway Sect first played at the 100 Club Punk Festival in 1976 and recorded two Peel sessions. Vic Godard continued making music throughout four decades. Recent LP, 'We Come as Aliens' with influences from northern soul to punk has received great reviews. The line-up for this show includes original bass player Paul Myers (back after 30 years) and Paul Cook from The Sex Pistols on drums. Viv Albertine is best known as the guitarist for the influential, all-female English punk band, The Slits. After the group disbanded Viv took a break from music. She is now back with a renewed passion and a collection of powerful, provocative &amp; personal songs. The Slits recorded three John Peel sessions between 1977-81. The Television Personalities are an English post-punk group with a varying line up. The only constant member is singer/songwriter Dan Treacy. Their first release (January 1978) was the single "14th Floor / Oxford Street W1". Their second release, the E.P Where's Bill Grundy Now? features one of their best-known songs, "Part Time Punks". Their first album 'And Don't the Kids Just Love It' was released in 1981. It set the template for their subsequent career: neo-psychedelia, an obsession with youth culture of the 1960s, a fey, slightly camp lyrical attitude, and the occasional classic pop song. Despite their small sales the TVPs were very influential on British music in the 1980s, especially the so-called C86 generation and many of the bands on Creation Records. They recorded their first John Peel session in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Fil Campbell Irish songbird - &#163;9. Caravans and Campervans &#163;5 Bickerton Village Hall, Long Lane, Bickerton, SY14 8AU. Info Liz 01606 834969 or Lynne 077 900 82523 tickets www.cheshirefolk.com These are the songs that come to every Irish music lovers lips at the pluck of a harp or the sight of a pint of Guinness. There could be no better songbird than Fil Campbell to lovingly recreate the songs and life stories of our Irish forebears with this live performance. Fil Campbell grew up in Belleek in Co. Fermanagh in the North of Ireland. She was brought up on the folk songs that were popular in Fermanagh and Donegal and spent her childhood immersed in music. With both ceilidh bands and singers in the family, music was all around and performance was part of everyday life, both at home and at school. She started singing semi professionally while still at school, returning to full time performing in the 1990s after a spell working as a music publicist and radio presenter for BBC Northern Ireland. Belleek is the home of the world famous Belleek Pottery, where Fil's father worked all his life, and where she in turn spent several Summer holidays working. Fil returned to her roots for a project called Songbirds, which has formed the focus of her last CD and her current release Farewell to Cold Winter. A collection of charming Irish folk songs that formed the musical backdrop to Ireland of the 30s, 40s and 50s, Songbirds accompanies a TV show and DVD of the same name, which profiles the women singers of that period. Fil both performed in and narrated this documentary series which is already being seen as a valuable contribution to Irish traditional music archives. Dublin's Evening Herald commented that her voice was eminently suited to these old gems and she has a knack of making every song sound brand new. Part of the Irish music industry all her life, Fil has recorded 3 earlier CDs of original and contemporary Irish songs, has appeared on countless radio and television programmes at home and abroad, has toured extensively, and has presented her own radio and TV shows in Ireland&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Farncombe Cavern is pleased to welcome back Nicky Swann, who performed here last on the on the 3rd September 2010. Devon born songwriter Nicky Swann is a performer with a passion. Her delivery is warm, soulful (sometimes gritty) but always spiritually tinged. She uses elements of folk, blues and country to tell her tales of love, hope and death. After splitting from her covers duo and long term guitarist in 2006 Nicky searched for a replacement but was disappointed by those she auditioned. Determined to continue, she decided to take on the role of guitarist herself and quickly expanded her three chord repertoire and was gigging again after six months. She started to write new material and relaunched herself as a singer-songwriter. Since then she hasn't looked back and her achievements to date include, recording with the top multi-instrumentalist Phil Beer (Show of Hands), winning the Artsbase singer-songwriter award, supporting many top UK artists including Clive Gregson, Reg Meuross, Roy Bailey and Megson as well as American artists Corrine West and Brooks Williams. She has headlined the acoustic stage at Transition Festival, supported Show Of Hands at Chagstock and is a regular performer at Dartmouth Music Festival. She has performed live for BBC Radio including an impromptu performance with award winning folk singer and fiddle player Jackie Oates. She has achieved a growing, well respected reputation in such a short space of time, singing from the heart and captivating audiences with her emotionally honest delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Their set will include tracks from their album "Water Under the Bridge".</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Their reunion gig at The Farncombe Cavern in April 2011 SOLD OUT, so if you don&#8217;t want to miss the chance to see House at one of their rare live gigs, buy your tickets early! The gig in April was a social event as well as a celebration of their music, with fans and friends travelling from far and wide, desperate not to miss seeing this seminal Guildford band with their original line-up, play live again. HOUSE was born in May 1976 from the ashes of two local Guildford bands - ASYLUM and BACKHURST. Tony Backhurst (singer-songwriter -guitarist) joined forces with Sev Lewkowicz (keyboards - vocals). They recruited Tim Wheatley (ex Gracious!) on bass, and initially performed as a three piece. The band broke up in the early 80s, and Sev went on to play with Mungo Jerry, Any Trouble and Duffo. More recently Sev has toured the UK with Doctor Hook singer Dennis Locorriere. They have been joined by drummer Matt Wheatley, who has done a 15 year shift with blues rockers Cryin' Out Loud with Tim by his side on bass. Matt is about to tour with American 60s legends &#8216;It&#8217;s a Beautiful Day&#8217; who are headlining at this year&#8217;s Isle of Wight Festival. Their set will include tracks from their album "Water Under the Bridge" as well as many previously unrecorded songs. They are sure that this &#8216;new' House for the &#8216;new millennium' will meet with approval from their old fans, and also gain them a generation of new ones. - "The songs are soft focus affairs concerning love, good times, missed opportunity and more than a deal of reflection. &#8216;Photograph' the honourable exception is an acute tale of life lost in Ulster's troubles, &#8216;Amsterdam Rain' a 70s rite of passage which anyone with long hair, a back pack and a memory can relate to. &#8216;Water Under the Bridge' proves their music's gone the distance". - Folk Roots "The bulk of the composing and lead vocals are handled by Tony Backhurst. He is sometimes reminiscent of Dave Cousins of The Strawbs, although the standard of his writing seems more even than The Strawbs ever achieved". - John Tobler NME&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>A great band and interesting career to watch&#8230;</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The 2002 release of Insomnium&#8217;s debut album, In the Halls of Awaiting, caught most off-guard. In many ways, it can be looked upon as a "sleeper" album, with sales continuing to build to the current day. With the release of the band&#8217;s second album, Since the Day All Came Down, the growing profile and interest in this still relatively young Finnish band should find them reaching to the next stage in their continuing development. "In The Halls Of Awaiting is an impressive accomplishment, incorporating depression, self-deprecation and dark melody into a package worthy of your time," said Digital Metal of the melodic death metal band&#8217;s initial offerings. With early In Flames, Amorphis, Opeth and the more organic sounds of Children of Bodom as a drawing comparison, the four-piece craft a sound that is familar yet truly their own. "Stirring groovy, riff-mad melodic metal," says Brave Words. "From start to finish, In the Halls of Waiting is a solid example of how emotionally powerful music can be," says Ink 19. Since the Day All Came Down contains the same solid songwriting, impeccable musicianship and inventiveness that made In the Halls of Awaiting a success but with expanding concepts and lyrical adventures. The album finds the band truly coming into their own with a maturity that continues to be well beyond their years. Formed in 1997, Insomnium are based in the eastern-most region of Finland. The band would record two demos before signing to Candlelight in 2001 &#8211; both receiving "demo of the month" honors from Terrorizer. The band&#8217;s US fanbase continues to grow, including a healthy support network at college/loud rock radio which will no doubt embrace Since the Day All Came Down. A great band and interesting career to watch&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;About Brooks: Brooks Williams is one of the premier guitarists, singers and songwriters on the Roots Blues Americana scene. Lauded as one of the Top 100 Acoustic Guitarists of all time, Williams has been wowing audiences worldwide for nearly 24-years with his silky voice, hook-laden songs, and rollicking acoustic and resonator slide guitars, every night delivering the deepest and most intense interpretations of everything from early blues songs to his recent original compositions. The San Antonio Light calls him "a fret monster who has to be seen to be believed!"&#65279; About Ledfoot: Ledfoot is probably the best solo live performer you will ever see. Well known from the legendary band The Havalinas, Ledfoot has developed his own solo style with only his 12 string guitar and foot stomps. But sure - nothing more is needed! His performance comes from his soul, a whiskey of maturity, seasoned, confident tattooed hands that fly across the guitar making it a instrument that has never been heard before. "A performance of Art." &#65279;&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Keith James presents a concert of Cohen's amazing material in the most intimate and sensitive manner possible.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;he most enigmatic and subtextural songwriter the English-speaking world has ever known, revered and covered by the entire music community... Leonard Cohen possesses an exact sense of prose, a wry sense of humour and the courage to wrestle with the unspoken, forgiving human frailty with the brush of each line. Keith James presents a concert of Cohen's amazing material in the most intimate and sensitive manner possible. Also included in the concert are poems by Federico Garc&#237;a Lorca and Leonard Cohen, which Keith has set to music. "certainly the UK's most celebrated and evocative interpreter of golden music" The Guardian "Keith James has become a pillar of trust. A sublimely intimate and engaging voice" Sunday Times&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Freedom Call were formed in 1998 around the nucleus of old friends Chris Bray (vocals and guitars) and drummer Daniel Zimmerman, who was [and still is] also a member of Gamma Ray, with whom Freedom Call are touring Europe with throughout February and March 2010. Guitarist Lars Rettkowitz and bassist Samy Saemann complete the Freedom Call line-up. Freedom Call&#8217;s debut album, &#8216;Stairway to Fairyland&#8217;, released in 1999, sold over 35,000 copies and firmly established the band at the forefront of the emerging power metal scene. Tours with the likes of Saxon and Angra saw the band developing a huge live following, boosted by numerous slots on major European festivals such as Wacken Open Air in Germany, where they continue appear higher up the bill every time they release an album. Following the release of &#8216;Crystal Empire&#8217;, Freedom Call&#8217;s second album, in 2001, the band set off on a 63 date European tour with Hammerfall and Virgin Steele. After the release of &#8216;Eternity&#8217;, their 3rd album, Freedom Call toured with Blind Guardian, during which they recorded their &#8216;Live Invasion&#8217; album, before starring on the Wacken Road Show 2004. &#8216;The Circle of Life&#8217;, released in 2005, saw the integration of more contemporary and unusual arrangements into the band&#8217;s sound, extending the musicians sonic range, further developed on &#8216;Dimensions&#8217;, released in 2007. Powerplay&#8217;s Adam Harrold awarded &#8216;Dimensions&#8217; 8/10 in July 2007&#8217;s issue, enthusing &#8220;It&#8217;s thrashier, more melodic and more topical than any of their efforts thus far&#8230;It&#8217;s a brilliant fusing of all the things that detractors would say is wrong with power metal.

  <short_description>Boasting a first class line up and two rooms of live music, performance poetry and audio-visuals, this night promises to be a very special event. This night will be one of a small handful of self promoted UK dates for headline act The Mob.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Boasting a first class line up and two rooms of live music, performance poetry and audio-visuals, this night promises to be a very special event. This night will be one of a small handful of self promoted UK dates for headline act The Mob. Full Line Up: The Mob Zounds Rubella Ballet The Astronauts The Hamsters Idiot Strength Andy T The Mob There is something uniquely English about The Mob which to this day is difficult to define. A loose, understated eccentricity. A visceral emotionality and a strangeness, fuelled by their association with free festivals and LSD and exemplified by the Porky Prime Cut messages scratched on the inner groove of their records: &#8216;Acid Punks&#8217;, &#8216;Take a trip down&#8217; etc. Unlike most of the Crass-type bands, The Mob never offered any solutions or calls for action. They simply described how things were and how they felt. While Crass et al attempted to inspire through anger, The Mob inspired through being truthful, honest and un-judgemental. While some put forward pacifism as an answer and others direct action, The Mob offered no answers at all and in this respect they were just like &#8216;us&#8217; because &#8216;we&#8217; also had no real answers. We all knew the world was wrong but none of us really knew what to do about it. It is this aspect of The Mob that makes them very important in the scheme of 1980&#8217;s anarcho punk rock. (and the current climate.) They are closer to &#8216;the people&#8217; than most other bands, closer I imagine than they ever really knew. Though the music they played is relatively simple, the sound the band made is very big and it translated well from small squatted venues to more sizeable and established venues, from small audiences to larger free festival audiences. Equally important of course, the sound translated well to each listener alone in their homes and this &#8216;personal connection&#8217; is something that resonates with Mob fans old and new. The Mob that is currently performing is the original three members Mark, Curtis and Graham reunited after 28 years, alive and well and tighter&#8230;.. and as potent as ever before . Let The Tribe Increase&#8230;.. Zounds Legendary English underground band Zounds first came to prominence in the early 1980s with a string of independent chart hits on Rough Trade and Crass Records. Growing out of the squatter communities of London and the south east they quickly became key figures in the burgeoning D.I.Y. anarcho-punk scene and toured Britain and Europe with contemporaries such as Crass, The Birthday Party, Poison Girls, The Mob, and many others. On record their sound was a little more expansive than many of their punk contemporaries. Their Rough Trade album &#8216;The Curse Of Zounds&#8217; is now seen as a classic of the genre and one of the most inspirational albums of the post-punk period. Since their early 1980s heyday Zounds have only played and toured intermittently. Song writer and lead singer Steve Lake is notoriously reclusive and can only rarely be persuaded to come out and play. The current line up is Steve Lake &#8211; guitar, Paul O&#8217;Donnell &#8211; bass, Paul Gilbert &#8211;drums. Their new album &#8216;The Redemption Of Zounds&#8217; is out now. Rubella Ballet Formed in 1979 by Sidation (Flux of Pink Indians), Zillah Minx, Pete Fender &amp; Gem Stone (Fatal Microbes) at the Crass gig at Conway Hall where Crass invited the audience to use their equipment and finish off the evening doing their own thing as they wanted and left the crowd in charge, so Sid being 6&#8221; 9 inches tall and at the front of the stage climed up with Zillah and jumped on Penny&#8217;s drum kit, Zillah grabbing Steve&#8217;s mic, Pete &amp; Gem jumping staight up and taking the bass and guitar, plugged in and started playing. Sounding like rather organised chaos this was the start of a very colourful part of what was and is the British anarcho punk scene. The band are well known for their tribal power, haunting lyrics, psychedelic stage show and the use of nothing more than a UV lights, strobes and a bit of smoke to illuminate the band, the music has the same innovative psychedelic qualities fusing punk, tribal, dance and absolute weirdness into a myriad of music styles. The Astronauts Formed in the late 70s by singer and songwriter Mark Astronaut and were active participants in the burgeoning free music scene instigated by Here and Now. They played many dates including the infamous Weird Tales Tour with Zounds and The Mob and a myriad other artists of the time. Musically and lyrically diverse they did not fit easily into any convenient pigeon hole, which ensured that, to an extent, they were seen as peripheral rather than central to the &#8220;punk movement&#8221;, although spiritually and idealistically sympathetic. http://www.astronauts.org.uk The Hamsters Formed in 1979 and split while what would have been a debut album for Fuck Off records in December 1980, in that period they played with Joy Division and the fall on a regular basis and frequently guested on the wierd tales tours with the mob, androids of mu and zounds , always volotile going through 8 bassists in that spell the end came as no surprise. a brief reunion crashed after 4 gigs in 1983 , a further attempt at reconciliation ended mid first gig in 2002, egos alcohol and drugs now more under control the 2011 hamsters have already managed 2 radio sessions and a gig without imploding, they are as ramshackle and high spirited as ever. Idiot Strength Formed in Bristol in 84. The original line up was Mathew Brett on drums (now sadly deceased) Giles Coe (Bass) and Steve Corr (guitar and vox). Mathew Brett left to go traveling and was replaced by Andy Tuck who had previously played with Thatcher On Acid and later with Schwartzeneggar. Matt was soon followed by Giles who was then replaced by Chaz (Charles Loft) formerly of Flowers in the Dustbin fame. The band continued in much the same manner. Chaz left after a year or so and was replaced by Bob Butler. During their time in London time they had various lead guitarists, the last of whom and perhaps the best was Dan who had previously played and sang with Blind Mole Rat. Andy Tuck quit sometime around 94-95 and two other drummers were recruited the last of whom &#8220;Yowla&#8221; is now playing for Adam Ant on his latest tour. Sadly the band never recorded and stuttered to a halt in 96. Bob, Steve &amp; Andy recently played a couple of songs at the recent Mob gig in Bristol and again more recently at the secret Mob Gig at the Macbeth in Hoxton. Andy T Anarcho punk poet from the 70&#8217;s/80&#8217;s. Re-energised and re-awakened 18 months ago. Performing with a band these days. Old &amp; new material seems as relevant as ever, for these troubled times, ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The legendary neo-psychedelic cult band The Bevis Frond return for a special concert appearance at the 229 Club on Great Portland Street, London on Saturday 19th November.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Bevis Frond is Nick Saloman, a neo-psychedelic renaissance man and the sole writer, performer, and producer behind the cottage industry bearing the Frond name. Saloman is a quintessential English eccentric, a frighteningly prolific talent and a true anachronism purveying an archaic musical genre while simultaneously pioneering the lo-fi aesthetic. Saloman cloaked his formative years in mystery; according to legend, he formed his first band, the Bevis Frond Museum, during his school years. Then after founding the Von Trapp Family, later known as Room 13, Saloman was sidelined in 1982 following a motorcycle accident. With the money he received as compensation for his injuries, he revived the Bevis Frond name and during his recuperation period assembled 1986&#8242;s Miasma, a slice of twisted, latter-day psychedelia issued on Woronzow in a pressing of 250. Much to Saloman&#8217;s shock, the record sold out; realizing an audience existed for his brand of time-warped pop, he quickly issued Inner Marshland, another underground success which encouraged him to raid his extensive archives for more material. Many successful releases followed and with support from John Peel amongst others Saloman made his live debut in 1990 appearing sporadically with an ever changing group of backing musicians. After 1990&#8242;s Magic Eye, a joint collaboration with former Pink Fairy Twink, the Bevis Frond issued its acknowledged masterpiece, 1991&#8242;s double-LP set New River Head; erratic and eclectic, Saloman&#8217;s output continued on without concession to trends or consumer tastes and now after fours away they return&#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Performing tracks from his new studio album &#8220;How To Compose Popular Songs That Will Sell&#8221; and hits of The Boomtown Rats, this will be Bob Geldof&#8217;s first theatre tour in over 3 years. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Bob Geldof is an Irish singer, songwriter, author, occasional actor and political activist. He rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Irish rock band The Boomtown Rats in the late 1970s and early 1980s alongside the punk rock movement. The band had hits with his compositions "Rat Trap" and "I Don't Like Mondays". He co-wrote, "Do They Know It's Christmas?&#8221; one of the best-selling singles of all time for Live Aid. In total, Live Aid raised over &#163;150 million for famine relief. Geldof was subsequently knighted, at age 34, for his efforts. He has released a new album &#8220;How To Compose Popular Songs That Will Sell&#8221; on the Mercury Record label. It is his first album since 2001&#8217;s &#8220;Sex, Age &amp; Death&#8221; and is his fifth album as a solo artist (his eleventh if you include his work in his band the Boomtown Rats). The album features 14 new Geldof compositions recorded with his band in his home and in various friends&#8217; studios and produced by his longtime collaborator Pete Briquette.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Sarah McQuaid is a versatile and beguiling performer. In addition to her own elegantly crfted originals, she interprets traditional Irish and Appalachian folk songs, Elizabethan ballads, surprise covers and lively guitar instrumentals.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Renowned for her warm, engaging stage presence, Sarah McQuaid is a versatile and beguiling performer. In addition to her own elegantly crafted originals, she interprets traditional Irish and Appalachian folk songs, Elizabethan ballads, 1930s jazz numbers, surprise covers and lively guitar instrumentals with panache and poignance. Her deliciously earthy voice delivers a powerful emotional punch that&#8217;s matched by her distinctive, eloquent guitar style. Add this to a real rapport with her audience, and you have all the ingredients of a great night out. Born in Spain, raised in Chicago and holding dual Irish and American citizenship, Sarah was taught piano and guitar by her folksinging mother, and remembers being inspired by meeting her distant cousin, well-known singer/songwriter/storyteller Gamble Rogers, at her grandmother&#8217;s house in Indiana. From the age of twelve she was embarking on tours of the US and Canada with the Chicago Children&#8217;s Choir, and at eighteen she went to France for a year to study philosophy at the University of Strasbourg. Sarah moved to Ireland in 1994, and three years later released her debut solo album, When Two Lovers Meet. &#8220;Sarah&#8217;s voice is both as warm as a turf fire and as rich as matured cognac.... An astonishing debut by a unique talent,&#8221; wrote the Rough Guide To Irish Music. Despite the critical acclaim, a long break from the music scene followed, during which Sarah married Feargal Shiels and had two children, Eli and Lily Jane. When Two Lovers Meet was re-released in Ireland and the UK in 2007, a year that also saw Sarah touring as a solo artist for the first time and moving with her family to Cornwall, in the southwest corner of England. The following autumn she released her second album, I Won&#8217;t Go Home &#8217;Til Morning, which like its predecessor was recorded in Trevor Hutchinson&#8217;s Dublin studio and produced by Gerry O&#8217;Beirne. Sarah is also the author of The Irish DADGAD Guitar Book, described by The Irish Times as &#8220;a godsend to aspiring traditional guitarists,&#8221; and has presented workshops on the DADGAD tuning at festivals and venues around the globe. Crow Coyote Buffalo, an album of songs co-written by Sarah with fellow Penzance resident Zo&#235; (author and performer of 1991 hit single &#8216;Sunshine On A Rainy Day&#8217;) under the band name Mama, has also been garnering rave reviews since its January 2009 release; one critic described the pair as &#8220;Two pagan goddesses channelling the ghost of Jim Morrison.&#8221; In 2010, Sarah re-released her first two albums in a double-disc package for the North American market, to coincide with her first US tour. The double CD became the No. 1 album, and Sarah the No. 1 artist, on the folkradio.org chart (based on playlists from 195 DJs) for February 2010 (http://folkradio.org/airplay/feb10.html); the final tally at year&#8217;s end saw the double CD in the No. 6 slot for the year, bea..ng powerful competition from far more established artists. Now spending approximately six months of each year on the road in Ireland, the UK, Europe and the USA, Sarah was an official showcase artist at the International Folk Alliance conference in February 2011. She returned to the studio in June 2011 to record her third solo album, provisionally titled The Plum Tree and the Rose, once again with Gerry O&#8217;Beirne producing and Trevor Hutchinson engineering. The focus this time round is on Sarah&#8217;s own songwriting: nine of the thirteen tracks on the album are self-penned, three of these as co-writes with Gerry O&#8217;Beirne. O&#8217;Beirne also guests on the album, alongside Hutchinson on double bass, Bill Blackmore on trumpet and flugelhorn, Rod McVey on keyboards, violinists M&#225;ire Breatnach and Rosie Shipley, and percussionists Liam Bradley and Noel Eccles. Title track &#8216;The Plum Tree and the Rose&#8217;, one of two tracks performed solo by Sarah on vocal and guitar, sets the twin themes of spiritual ques..oning and the relationship between soul and place &#8211; themes that are developed in a trio of songs inspired by buildings: &#8216;In Derby Cathedral&#8217;, &#8216;Hardwick&#8217;s Lofty Towers&#8217; and &#8216;Kenilworth&#8217;. Other originals include &#8216;Lift You Up and Let You Fly&#8217;, a poignant ballad about the pain of letting go, &#8216;The Sun Goes On Rising&#8217;, a bluesy rumination on hard economic times, &#8216;What Are We Going To Do&#8217;, a song whose old-school structure hearkens back to Golden Age songwriters like Rodgers &amp; Hart and Cole Porter, the wistful &#8216;So Much Rain&#8217; and the six-part canon &#8216;In Gratitude I Sing,&#8217; on which Sarah is joined by a chorus of guest vocalists &#8211; among them well-known Irish singer Niamh Parsons. Canons are another running theme of the album: &#8216;In Derby Cathedral&#8217; has a canon by way of a postscript, and one of the album&#8217;s four non-original tracks is &#8216;New Oysters New&#8217;, a three-part canon published in 1609 by Thomas Ravenscroft in his Pammelia: Mvsicks Miscellanie and sung here by McQuaid, Parsons and baritone Tom Barry. Also on the menu are 16th century Elizabethan composer John Dowland&#8217;s &#8216;Can She Excuse My Wrongs&#8217;, which like the title track is a spare voice-and-guitar-only arrangement, &#8216;S&#8217;Anc Fuy Belha Ni Prezada&#8217;, a 13th century &#8220;alba&#8221; or dawn song in Old Occitan, and a cover of John Martyn&#8217;s &#8216;Solid Air&#8217;. The album is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Shantel, and his live Bucovina Club Orkestar, is back for his third megaparty at Camden's Koko bringing the hottest Gypsy Beats from the Balkans to the clubs and festivals of the world from Ibiza to Istanbul. It'll be a party not to forget!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The undisputed King of the vodka-fuelled Gypsy Beat, Shantel, returns to Koko for an exclusive UK show with a party to remember on his 13 Years of Anarchy and Romance Tour 2011. With a background as a respected electronic dance producer for hip label K7, Shantel started playing clubs, parties and festivals around the world with a new sound that had its roots in Balkans &#8211; and from day one drove crowds wild with ecstatic bliss. Whether he DJs or plays live with a band, Shantel has the knack for turning any venue into a vortex of pure euphoria, where the Balkan bounce takes over and everyone turns into an expert bellydancer on the spot. Love and good vibes are in the air; his last two KOKO shows were no different. Now reaching 6 million views of his Youtube hit Disko Partizani, he's brought the Balkans to clubland, and his work has inspired a whole generation of DJs who have broadened their horizons from house, techno and breakbeats to embrace a new sound. Disdainful of political borders, artificial musical categories and the generation gap, Shantel's music has effectively straddled cultures. It is equally at home at festivals such as the crazy Guca Brass Festival in Serbia, where in 2010 he performed together on stage with the legendary Boban and Marko Markovic Orkestar, to Glastonbury and Roskilde, with people of all ages dancing to his tunes. His remix of Mahala Rai Banda's Mahalageasca was prominently used in the soundtrack of the Borat movie. Shantel will be appearing with his full live band and will be performing some of his classic numbers as well as plenty of new material in an evening you'll wish didn't have to end.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Symptomatic heads to the south coast on November 24th to host the Brighton leg of THE MOONS autumn tour. ANDY CROFTS takes a break from playing keys in the PAUL WELLER band to bring his own very popular brand of neo-mod to the kids.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Fronted by Paul Weller&#8217;s keyboard player Andy Crofts and featuring Chris Ketley previously of the Rakes, the band craft soulful slices of classic English pop. Taking a traditional 60&#8217;s sound and weaving in influences as diverse as XTC and The Specials, the resulting album straddles the decades and sits comfortably alongside contemporary groups like The Coral, The Zutons and The Bees. &#8220;&#8230;fizzes with ideas, pinballing from bristling mod pop and paranoic freakbeat to intoxicating wafts of Mersey psychedelia&#8230;&#8221; **** &#8211; Q&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>ANTI-NOWHERE LEAGUE
Supports T.B.A
Thursday 24th November @ Bogiez
Tickets &#163;10.00 Advance / &#163;12.00 On Door</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The infamous and legendary group of hardcore punk rock anarchists, Anti Nowhere League have been living the punk lifestyle for over two decades. Lead singer Animal and his friend Magoo formed the band in 1980, and promptly got arrested at their very first gig. The history of the League is littered with brushes with the law, rock and roll misbehaviour and very loud music. There have been band break-ups and reformations aplenty, but Animal and his chums can be found plying their wares to this very day!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Brutally catchy punkrock/metal with a taste of groovy darkness!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Brutally catchy punkrock/metal with a taste of groovy darkness! Kvelertak shamelessly draw inspiration from every corner of something that could fit into their idea of good hard-hitting and catchy rock&#8217;n'roll. Regardless of genre, but always truthful to the basic idea of the band; good songs performed with the tongue-in-cheek attitude of their punk-rock pioneers. Unlike the majority of heavier bands they sing in their native language &#8211; adding even more character to their already unique sound. Releasing their much anticipated debut album, Kvelertak are already well known in Norway for their furious live energy and catchy, melodic, metal-inspired punk rock. Outside Norway they are fairly unknown&#8230; yet.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Not many heavy metal bands can boast of chart positions and two-page bulletins in all the national newspapers for a debut album. Sahg can. With their gloomy chords, ten ton rhythms and a taste for the heavy rock pioneers of the seventies, the Bergen-based quartet had the audience and critics toss their hats in the air with excitement. Sahg I (2006) filled a void in the Norwegian metal fauna, and was an indisputable success in Norway, as well as abroad. The album got 10 out of 10 points in German Rock Hard Magazine, and 8 out of 10 in the UK edition of Metal Hammer. The success debut album brought the band on tour stateside, as opening act for extreme metal pioneers Celtic Frost, and made Sahg "the one to watch" at a string of metal festivals. Two years later, Sahg confirmed their status as Norway&#8217;s indisputable doom lords. Many considered Sahg II as a more refined album than the debut, and featuring spearhead tracks like Ascent to Decadence and Pyromancer, it became another door-opener for the quartet. Sahg II was mixed by Anthrax guitarist Rob Caggiano, and Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson gave it plenty of airplay on his weekly Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio 6. With a fistful of potential heavy rock classics and buckets of regained energy, Sahg once again entered Earshot Studio in December 2009. In collaboration with producers Herbrand Larsen and Ice Dale of Norwegian viking prog metal masters Enslaved, the band was ready for album number three. This time, the vision was to make things more direct and immediate, and let the riff be in center without drowning it in complex arrangements and excessive instrumentation. Similar to the formula of thrash metal kings Metallica and Slayer in their 1980s prime. Just check out new favorites, like Mortify, Baptism of Fire, Hollow Mountain, and Shadow Monument. Despite the obvious thrash metal influence, and a few elements of modern prog in the likes of Mastodon, there is no doubt who are handling the instruments. Olav Iversen&#8217;s characteristic voice, along with Thomas Tofthagen&#8217;s riff expertise, and the fine-tuned rhythm section consisting of Thomas L&#246;nnheim and Tom Cato Visnes (aka. King Ov Hell), still carry the unmistakable Sahg signature. Sahg III is the sound of a band that have made a few clever moves to refine an already solid expression, and to keep the fans engaged and excited about Sahg &#8211; the music, the magic, the mystique and the myth. Doubtlessly the most immediate and dynamic album the band has accomplished to date. New and old fans have a lot to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Alabama3 return to the Roadmender for another almighty show ... not one to be missed!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Alabama 3 is a pop band, a punk rock, blues and country techno situationist crypto-Marxist-Leninist electro band. We never went on X Factor or Pop Idol or Stooge Quest. We did it the old fashioned way; Back in 1996, we threw a big old party, invited all our friends. We took a fistfull of blotters and half a dozen disco biscuits and then made it up as we went along. Geffen records bought it..! for a million dollars! We never needed a self-appointed quango of jaded vampires to tell us how to sing the blues...we got Mojo*. We have the power to raise the dead. We spent half of our advance from Geffen on various contraband items and with the rest we made an over-produced, brilliant situationist masterpiece called 'Exile on Coldharbour Lane'. Ever since then we've been preaching our Gospel all over the world. We've got into a whole bunch of trouble and met a whole bunch of nice people. We make friends where ever we go. Larry and Rev D will see you at the front! Catch the Alabama3 at the Roadmender on Tuesday 29th November Doors Open: 19.30 Advance Tickets from : &#163;18.00 +bf Age restriction: Under 14's must be accompanied by an adult over 18&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Tyketto were an American heavy rock band of the 1990s who never achieved the success they felt they deserved. The group was put together in 1987 by former Waysted vocalist Danny Vaughn. Brooke St James (Guitar), Jimi Kennedy (Bass) and Micheal Clayton (Drums) completed the lineup. By 1990 the band had signed to Geffen Records, and released their debut album &#8220;Don&#8217;t Come Easy&#8221;. Musically, it was somewhere between Whitesnake and Bon Jovi, with Tyketto opening for the former on many bills. However, the rise of the &#8216;grunge&#8217; sound in 1991 saw Tyketto&#8217;s hopes of the big breakthrough begin to recede.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;With his trademark mix of humour and indignation, pop culture, political commentary and personal anecdote, healthy scepticism and his own belligerent form of optimism, Henry Rollins returns to Royal Festival Hall for a night of spoken word following his sold-out 2010 date. There are few who can match the breadth of Henry Rollins' CV. As frontman for both Rollins Band and Black Flag, he became a punk icon; as an actor he's appeared in over 20 films including David Lynch's Lost Highway; and as a writer he's published travel books, music journalism, political commentary and more.
