  <short_description>As part of the summer season of open-air cinema, The Nomad travels to the stunning Bodiam Castle in the East Sussex countryside for a mini-series of stunning films at this beautiful location. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Nomad Cinema brings Tom Hooper&#8217;s much-loved Royal drama to the wonderful Bodiam Castle, East Sussex&#8230; British Cinema&#8217;s unending fascination with Royalty was cemented this year with Tom Hooper&#8217;s money making, Oscar gobbling hit. Colin Firth plays the King in waiting who overcomes his chronic stuttering with the help of a Australian voice coach (played wonderfully by Geoffrey Rush) unwilling to play along to all the airs and graces expected of a commoner adressing his future Monarch. Firth gives the performance of his life and Helena Bonham Carter and Guy Pearce make the most of their relatively minor roles &#8211; although the less said about Timothy Spall&#8217;s Winston Churchill, the better. Hooper brings assurance and control to material that could veer into cloying sentimentality if put in the wrong hands. Yes, the story may be predictable and yes, it&#8217;s easy to sneer about how much sympathy we should feel for a rich toff, but if you join us in the glorious grounds of Bodiam Castle we&#8217;ll bet you a royal sovereign that there&#8217;ll be a tear in your eye by the time the credits begin to roll.

  <short_description>A dance theatre response to the global epidemic of body unease

</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;A dance theatre response to the global epidemic of body unease Choreographed by Maddy Wynne-Jones and set to an original score by Halogen, Body Of Work explores the increasing global pressure to perfect and design our bodies, as they become less where we live from and more what we can personally manufacture. Beautiful imagery and compelling viewing. Choreographer Maddy Wynne-Jones has created movement that is gripping in every way Susanne Allen, Dance Critic Fiercely evocative, this is a bold exploration into the epidemic and transgenerational transmission of body anxiety. Through daring physicality and honest frailty, Tempered Body takes an exhilarating and thought-provoking journey through the global war on bodies. Maddy Wynne-Jones&#8217; choreography is delicate and detailed. The story unfolds like a good book. Chantal Pierre-Packer, The Fringe Report Tempered Body Dance Theatre, &#8220;trailblazers in terms of quality work&#8221; (Libby Costello, LondonDance), have been gaining momentum since their beginning in 2007. Founded by Canadian choreographer Maddy Wynne-Jones, the company has been Resident Company of Chisenhale Dance Space since 2009, and in Aprill 2011 became Associate Company of Rich Mix. Body of Work, the company&#8217;s most ambitious piece to date, pushes physical and emotional boundaries and amplifies the integrity of our corporeal force.

  <short_description>As part of the summer season of open-air cinema, The Nomad travels to the stunning Lympne Castle in the Kent countryside for one of many in a series of stunning films in Kent. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The combined talents of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman conceived one of the greatest old-fashioned movie heroes of all time, introducing 80s cinema audiences to the iconic Indiana Jones. The equally iconic Harrison Ford was the perfect fit for the sardonic, reluctant army-of-one pitting his wits against Boys&#8217; Own comic book Nazis. Full of memorable characters and set-pieces, Raiders set box-offices alight and paved the way for not only the rest of the Indy franchise, but dozens of inferior imitators. There&#8217;s nothing like seeing the original adventure in the great outdoors &#8211; see you there&#8230; Tickets to be bought in advance from http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/raiders-lost-ark-lympne-castle-kent-2/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Join The Nomad's roaming pop-up cinema as E.T. touches down in amongst the trees in Bushy Park, as our Nostalgic Adventure mini-season continues with perhaps Spielberg&#8217;s best-loved movie.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;For one night only, E.T. touches down in amongst the trees in Bushy Park, as our Nostalgic Adventure mini-season continues with perhaps Spielberg&#8217;s best-loved movie. As the great, smooth and oddly oblong-faced Roger Ebert puts it: &#8221;E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial&#8221; is a reminder of what movies are for. Most movies are not for any one thing, of course. Some are to make us think, some to make us feel, some to take us away from our problems, some to help us examine them. What is enchanting about &#8220;E.T.&#8221; is that, in some measure, it does all of those things. Famously based on an imaginary friend Spielberg invented during his parents&#8217; messy divorce, the film was knocked back initially by Columbia Pictures, who described it as &#8220;a wimpy Disney movie&#8221;, only to be picked up by MCA &#8211; d&#8217;oh! There are so many great scenes and sequences, such inspirational music and effects, so many great ideas (leading to soooo many merchandising opportunities), so much heart, charm and love in the film, it&#8217;s easy to forget that this &#8220;wimpy Disney movie&#8221; is also quite a dark look at childhood, families and &#8220;the suburban ideal&#8221;. Come relive it yourself, or introduce a new generation to E.T. As with all our outdoor screenings, bring a blanket or low chair to sit on, and something warm to wear for after sunset. We&#8217;ll be doing 20 Nomad events in London&#8217;s Royal Parks this year &#8211; view the full schedule for Royal Parks outdoor cinema. And bear in mind, places are limited, so please do book in advance, to avoid disappointment!

  <short_description>Join The Nomad pop-up cinema as it continues its roam through beautiful parks as we return to Dulwich Park for the magnificent Amelie.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Amelie &#8211; romantic, doe-eyed sweetheart or scheming, manipulative bitch? You decide. To be honest, it&#8217;s really only the psychoanalysts in the room (park) who have a problem with the behaviour of Audrey Tautou&#8217;s unforgettable heroine in one of the most sensationally beautiful films ever created &#8211; he&#8217;s made a few, Jean Pierre-Jeunet, but this one takes the biscuit (we&#8217;re pronouncing that the French way). It&#8217;s just so beautiful to look at &#8211; the American Society of Cinematographers named it the best-shot film of the decade, and who are we to argue with them&#8230; Brilliant set-pieces, great sets, bad guys suffering, good guys getting it on &#8211; all thanks to guardian angel Amelie. It&#8217;s a film full of imagination and heart, and it&#8217;s going to look fantastic on our massive screen in the park, as the sun sets on the horizon and we open a second bottle&#8230; You&#8217;ll be greeted by intrepid gnomes who&#8217;ll help you find your way to the action and expect some lovely live music with a french feel to get you in the mood for love. Bon Appetit. Also coming to Dulwich Park near you soon: The Wicker Man on 24 July and The Goonies on 14 August. Join us for them all! Bring wine, a picnic, a blanket and something warm to wear for after sunset. See you there&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Nomad's roaming pop-up cinema (in conjunction with Kensal Rise's Lexi Cinema) touches down in West London's beautiful Queens Park with the ever brilliant Napoleon Dynamite</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s a fine line between really, really, really believing in yourself and massive self-delusion. Napoleon, Kip and Uncle Rico are all pretty close to that line. Just like you. Featuring some iconic fashion, BMX aerobatics, cage fighting, Tupperware, memorable part time jobs, chapped lips, the worst time machine ever, and the best political campaign ever, Napoleon Dynamite will put a stupid, slack-jawed grin on your idiot face. Again. Get down to the park early to test your Skills &#8211; you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to show them off in Napoleon&#8217;s Tetherball Arena. On the food and drink front, Uncle Rico will be inviting you to step back in time to his 1982 style margarita bar &#8211; you know, relive those glory days, maybe toss the ol&#8217; pigskin around&#8230; Airstream Alfresco will be preparing delicious quesadillas that Napoleon&#8217;s Grandma would be proud of, while Anna Mae&#8217;s Southern Street Food want your vote for their special Spicy Pedro mac &#8216;n&#8217; cheese. Needless to say, we&#8217;ll be pumping out some seriously bad taste tunes on the Nomad Sound System &#8211; so be ready to pull some sweet moves. And we&#8217;ll also have a prize for our best dressed guest on the night: bonus points for moon boots, scooby-doos and headbands &#8211; we&#8217;ll provide the awesome limited edition badges&#8230; Two other Nomad screenings on the Lexi&#8217;s home turf this year &#8211; we&#8217;re back in Queens Park on Sat 17 Sept for classic noir The Third Man, and will also be setting up camp for one night in Roundwood Park for Robert Zemeckis&#8217; feelgood 80s blockbuster, Back to the Future Part I on Sun 4 Sept. At all three events, if you&#8217;re a Lexi Cinema Member and you flash your card at us, we&#8217;ll give you a shiny &#163;2 back at the box office! Space is limited so please book your tickets in advance to avoid disappointment. http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/napoleon-dynamite-queens-park/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Having travelled and conquered the world (well, London and the Southeast) The Nomad returns home to NW10! Join us in one of the most beautiful little natural amphitheatres in award-winning Roundwood Park for 80s feelgood classic Back to the Future Part I. With more than a touch of It&#8217;s A Wonderful Life small town American dream about it, BTTF packs in action, comedy, sci-fi and romance, doesn&#8217;t waste a single line of dialogue and features career-best performances from Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. And Huey Lewis. Who&#8217;d a thunk Marty McFly could make such a charming hero &#8211; a peeping-Tom, Billy-no-mates, who hangs around with a mad scientist four times his age and finds himself in a love triangle with his mom and dad? We&#8217;ll have the iconic DeLorean car from the movie at Roundwood Park, so make sure you bring your camera and feel free to dress up in your best body warmer and hi-tops &#8211; or white boiler suit &#8211; for a nice little photo-souvenir. Grab yourself a burger and shake from Airstream Alfresco, or bring your own picnic. Pick up a cup of Spiked Prom Punch from the bar or smuggle in your own liquor &#8211; high school style, in a brown paper bag, obviously. We&#8217;ll have some limited edition Hill Valley High badges for you, and a selection of 50s Doo-Wop and early rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll to get you in the mood. And some Huey Lewis. So join us at Roundwood, to bathe in the double-nostalgia of it all &#8211; or to introduce a new generation to 1.21 gigawatts of fuuuuuuun&#8230; Oh, and if you fancy more open-air action on Lexi home turf, The Nomad will be popping up in Queens Park just down the road on Sat 3 Sept for Napoleon Dynamite and Sat 17 Sept for The Third Man. PS. If you&#8217;re a Lexi Cinema member, flash your card at us at the box office and we&#8217;ll give you a shiny &#163;2 nugget back!

  <short_description>The Nomad Cinema bring Wolfgang Peterson&#8217;s epic to the English Heritage site from which the Roman Army launched their successful invasion of Britain in 43AD.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Nomad Cinema bring Wolfgang Peterson&#8217;s epic to the English Heritage site from which the Roman Army launched their successful invasion of Britain in 43AD. Although it was Gladiator that made swords and sandals cool again, Wolfgang Peterson&#8217;s 2004 adaptation of Homer&#8217;s The Ilyiad redefined the word &#8216;epic&#8217; for modern Hollywood cinema. Brad Pitt stars as Achilles, a legendary warrior drawn into battle alongside the forces of ancient Greece against the people of Troy after their prince Paris (a snotty-nosed Orlando Bloom) runs away with the wife of a Greek King. This selfish act is the catalyst for a devastating war and the eventual destruction of an entire nation. And let&#8217;s not forget about that pesky horse&#8230; Peterson assembled a whopping cast &#8211; Eric Bana, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Diane Kruger and a rare appearance from a frazzled-looking screen legend Peter O&#8217;Toole are all stand-outs &#8211; and brings us some of the biggest and baddest battles ever committed to celluloid. It&#8217;s a film that demands to seen on a big screen, so where better than under the stars on a site that has seen its fair share of bloodshed over the years. We know it&#8217;s Roman rather than ancient Greek, but unless you want to pay for our airfare to Athens, we&#8217;ll be laying cinematic siege to this Historic site. There&#8217;ll be delicious catering on site and if you decide to come in fitting attire, remember to bring a lambskin cloak as it may well get chilly after the sun has set. Space is limited so tickets should be bought in advance to avoid disappointment - http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/troy-richborough-roman-fort-kent/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Polarbear presents Return</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Apples and Snakes presents Return Birmingham-born wordsmith Polarbear follows the successful national tour of If You Cover My Nose, You Can't See Me with a new forward-thinking live literature piece. Return tells the story of Noah, a man trying to figure out where he fits. Convinced he had to leave home in order to make his mark, Noah returns to find a world where a lot of things seem the same but nothing actually is. Combining storytelling with a distinctive lighting and projection design, Return exploits its relationship with cinematic genres. The show journeys through scenes and landscapes, encouraging you to explore and, like a film director, be challenged to re-imagine as the story unfolds...&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

The Day of the Peacock: Style for Men 1963-1973 with author Geoffrey Aquilina Ross, first men&#8217;s editor at Vogue.

Celebrating Vogue&#8217;s Fashion Night Out 2011</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s men&#8217;s fashion witnessed an extraordinary rebirth that led to lasting social, cultural and commercial change. Broad in range and scope, and neatly evoking the 1960s atmosphere of optimism and opportunity, Geoffrey reads from and looks at the eras most dashing figures &#8211; including John Stephen, Tommy Nutter, Cecil Beaton, Mick Jagger and Patrick Lichfield &#8211; and discusses such iconic shops as Granny takes a Trip, Blades, Hung on You and Mr Fish. This richly illustrated personal memoir evokes a definitive break from the past &#8211; from a time when one could invariably guess a man&#8217;s occupation from how he dressed, to a time when a man might make dressing himself his occupation.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Join The Nomad in the elegant and swoonsome surroundings of Fulham Palace for a celebration of heaving bosoms, powdered wigs, sly sexual machinations and general aristocratic French naughtiness with a screening of Dangerous Liaisons.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lust. Seduction. Revenge. The Game as you&#8217;ve never seen it played before.&#8221; Join us in the elegant and swoonsome surroundings of Fulham Palace for a celebration of heaving bosoms, powdered wigs, sly sexual machinations and general aristocratic French naughtiness. Bring your wine, your picnic, your finest stockings (gents) and your flirtiest demeanour for an evening of Rococo Royal Court posing, scheming and wooing, climaxing in a special screening under the stars of Stephen Frears&#8217; 1988 Hollywood debut, starring the incredible John Malkovich and Glenn Close &#8211; both having a ball as arch baddies &#8211; in the lead roles of the Vicomte Sebastian de Valmont and the Marquise Isabel de Meurteuil. It&#8217;s a sumptuous film, more than worthy of the Oscars it picked up for Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction and Best Adapted Screenplay for Christopher Hampton, who adapted the script from his own play, based on the 18th century novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos. Alors mesdames et messieurs, we look forward to making your acquaintance and enjoying a little of your company. May we recommend a blanket or low chair to sit on and perhaps something warm to cover yourself after sunset? Until then&#8230; Space is limited so please book in advance to avoid disappointment - http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/nomad-cinema-dangerous-liaisons-fulham-palace-london/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Windmill Golf Academy Family Fun Event Day raising money for Help For Heroes</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;On Saturday 10th September Windmill Golf Academy will be holding a FAMILY FUN DAY in support of the "Help For Heroes" charity. This will be a fun filled day with something for everyone - there will be games and activities including Golf Competitions, an Army Assault Course, Bungee Run and Sumo Suits. There will be a BBQ throughout the day and lots of attractions. Our Sponsored Events include: &#183; A 24 Hour Golfathon with our very own David Hoey in his record breaking attempt to hit 5,000 golf balls in 24 hours. &#183; The DOG (aka Steve Scott-Bowen, Director of Golf) has reluctantly accepted his fate to have his legs waxed if we are able to raise &#163;500 before 10 September. Please see the reception staff at Windmill for our sponsorship form to help us make this happen! &#183; A "Beat the Pro's" competition for those who feel confident enough to accept the challenge! It's not every day you get this opportunity! To end the day on a more relaxed note our evening entertainment will include live music from the Fabulous Rhythm Brothers and DJ Pop Daddy (Foxy Music, Bath) then a fabulous firework display to round the day off with a big bang. Windmill Golf Academy will be donating a percentage of the day's profits to the Help for Heroes Charity. To help us maximise our support we will be asking for voluntary contributions from anyone entering our Golf Events. For further information about Help for Heroes please see the H4H website.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A fishy favourite for all; children, adults and those wanting to watch a film just for the &#8216;halibut&#8217;! This Disney Pixar classic animation follows Marlin, a tiny clown fish, in his search to find his son Nemo (- also a tiny clown fish!) after he is scooped out of the sea by a diver and caged within a fish tank in a dental surgery. On Marlin&#8217;s mission to find Nemo, we meet memorable characters such as Dory, a Pacific Blue Regal tang with severe short-term memory loss, vegetarian sharks Bruce, Anchor and Chum, plus Mr Ray (self-explanatory!) and Crush &#8211; a surf-cultured sea turtle who has been riding the East Australian Current for 150 years. Meanwhile, captured in the fish tank in Sydney, Nemo meets the &#8216;Tank Gang&#8217; led by a crafty and ambitious moorish idol named Gill. After they try to initiate him into their gang, Nemo takes the oppor-&#8216;tuna&#8217;-ty to embark on an escape plan of his own&#8230; So &#8216;mussel&#8217; in on the action at Brockwell Lido &#8211; the perfect &#8216;plaice&#8217; for some aquatic adventures with Nemo and the gang!&#8221; Space is limited so please book your tickets in advance to avoid disappointment - http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/open-air-cinema-finding-nemo-brockwell-lido-london/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Nomad touches down in the wonderful city of Canterbury for our first of three special screenings at this stunning venue over the course of September&#8230;.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Nomad touches down in the wonderful city of Canterbury for our first of three special screenings over the course of September&#8230;. The sadly departed Patrick Swayze holds the record the playing the least scary ghost in cinema history. Fact. Maybe it&#8217;s the extravagantly volumous barnet, maybe it&#8217;s the fact that he doesn&#8217;t really get down to much in the way of haunting, but you can guarantee that even the scardest of scardy cats would feel ne&#8217;er a goose pimple. This is irrelevant as Ghost is a wonderful film and boasts the Swayze at his career best. He plays Sam, an honest joe killed during a botched mugging who remains stuck on earth to guard the love of his life (Demi Moore). Whoopie Goldberg steals every scene (almost) as a fast-talking &#8216;psychic&#8217; who&#8217;s as surprised as Sam is to learn that she can actually see the dead. To give away more would be robbing those lucky souls who are yet to experience Swayze&#8217;s mega-mullet of a truely heartwarming slice of cinema. And if you join us down at the spooky St Augustine&#8217;s Abbey, we at the Nomad will be giving you a chance to recreate scenes from the movie &#8211; and you know what scene we&#8217;re talking about! That&#8217;s right, bring some clothes that ain&#8217;t too precious and get ready for a spin on our pottery wheel &#8211; we&#8217;ll have a camera on hand to record your special moment and the best approximation of sir Patrick of Swayze&#8217;s bouffant will win you a special prize.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Join The Nomad for a one-off special screening of Baz Luhrmann&#8217;s dazzling and sumptuous Romeo + Juliet in the wonderful setting of Regent&#8217;s Park Open Air Theatre.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for a one-off special screening of Baz Luhrmann&#8217;s dazzling and sumptuous Romeo + Juliet in the wonderful setting of Regent&#8217;s Park Open Air Theatre. Pure hurtling passion, this. Luhrmann lit a rocket under the well-known tale of star-cross&#8217;d lovers, swapped daggers for guns, &#8216;fair Verona&#8217; for Verona beach &#8211; a brilliantly decaying hybrid of Miami Beach and Mexico City &#8211; and sent his camera careering across beautiful and lurid sets, beautiful young actors, to a Nellee Hooper-overseen soundtrack of pumping MTV-friendly rock, taking in The Cardigans, Kym Mazelle and Radiohead. Leonardo di Caprio and Clare Danes are perfectly cast at the centre of this, with solid support in the shape of Paul Sorvino, Pete Postlethwaite, Brian Dennehy and John Leguizamo, memorable as fiery Tybalt. The unique surroundings of Regent&#8217;s Park Open Air theatre provide the backdrop for this Nomad Cinema special, with a few surprises lined up to bring the film to life under the stars. As with all our outdoor screenings, we would suggest that you bring something warm to wear for after sunset. The theatre is a 10min walk from Baker Street underground station. There will be hot and cold food, hot drinks and a full licensed bar on site. Space is limited so please book your tickets in advance to avoid disappointment - http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/regentspark/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>'Kid, I wrote back' has solidified itself as one of the most fresh, exciting and eclectic poetry and spoken word nights London has to offer. Bringing both established and new poets together for an evening of words and rhymes.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Purposefully breaking free from promoting any one verse, word, voice or style KID, stamps a defiantly individual mark onto the capital's red-ripe spoken word and poetry scene. KID, I WROTE BACK invites both established and as yet unheard talent to the stage to perform &#8211; offering a much needed dose of full-on liberalism and authenticity &#8211; that will agitate, challenge and tickle your minds. It is a platform for current words from current poets of all styles and experience who are looking to share words and hear others in a friendly and lively environment. It is the brainchild of Chim&#232;ne Suleyman, a writer and poet who performs as part of the Rhymes Won&#8217;t Wait collective and Dylan Sage, a writer and emcee who has entertained with the likes of The Nextmen and Breaking Bread. Tonight we have Joshua Idehen and Musa Okwonga from London's poetry collective 'Pip'. LV and Joshua Idehen have recently collaborated on spoken word album 'Routes'. Musa is one half (the poetry half) of the spoken word and electronica duo The King's Will. Read a review here: http://www.factmag.com/2011/05/10/lv-joshua-idehen-routes/ &#163;3 on the door/FREE to perform. Doors open 7:30, words start at 8pm. If you would like to perform email kidiwroteback@instorage.org.uk or get there early on the night to sign up. kidiwroteback@instorage.org.uk www.facebook.com/kidiwroteback www.myspace.com/kidiwroteback&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>As part of a summer of pop-up open-air cinema, The Nomad travels to the beautiful Priory Park in Reigate for a special screening of Ghost </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Ghost is another one of those movies that we at Nomad HQ love to wheel out when we&#8217;re feeling romantic. We slap on The Best of the Righteous Brothers on our cassette player, we tousle our hair until it reaches the perfect Swayze-esque bouffant, fire up the potters wheel and get ready to sniffle and snuffle our way through one of modern cinema&#8217;s most romantic cheese treats. We all know the set-up; man gets killed in bungled mugging and through the power of love remains on earth to watch over his lady and help her find his killer. Chuck Whoopie Goldberg in to the mix as a fast talking con artist who can see the dead and you&#8217;ve got yourself a solid gold box office success. Airplane! Director Jerry Zucker plays all the right notes in a film that has endured. Beautiful Priory Park is worth the ticket price alone &#8211; be sure to get there early to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the food and drink on offer from our friends at Airstream Alfresco, whose shining, curvacious trailer is a beacon of gastronomic inspiration (they do booze too). We&#8217;ll be giving you lucky punters the chance to recreate one of cinema&#8217;s iconic scenes, so make sure to dress accordingly. Remember to bring a jumper and a loved one for when the sun sets as we don&#8217;t want you catching cold. Tickets to be bought in advance from http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/ghost-priory-park/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Stunning Scotney Castle in Kent provides the suitably escapist venue for The Nomad's pop-up cinema and the unstoppably feelgood summertime smash that is Mamma Mia! </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The wonderful grounds of Scotney Castle provide the suitably escapist venue for the unstoppably feelgood summertime smash that is Mamma Mia! Join us under the stars for some of the best pop songs ever written. Meryl Streep reinvented herself as a musical performer of great panache and conviction, Pierce Brosnan confirmed our worst fears about his vocal ability and penchant for linen, while Colin Firth managed to escape stereotyping as an repressed English gent&#8230; The Nomad always looks forward to pink night skies, pink wine and bawling along to Mamma Mia! Doors open at 6pm. Bring a low chair or blanket to sit on, and something warm to wear for later on. Space is limited so tickets should be bought in advance to avoid disappointment - http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/mamma-mia-scotney-castle/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The iconic 1976 horror returns to the biggest of screens, in the grounds of Fulham Palace, Bishop&#8217;s Park, where some of the film&#8217;s most terrifying scenes were shot. You surely know about the curse of The Omen? And that Fulham Palace is haunted? You don&#8217;t? Well, never mind about that for now &#8211; just buy your ticket, find a friend who doesn&#8217;t mind you jumping on them in terror, and bring a stiff drink with you. You might need it. So might some of our priests on duty that night&#8230; Bring something warm to wear for when the moon eclipses the sun and those shivers up your spine take over. And please present any birthmarks for inspection at the box office. May the lord be with you. Space is limited so please book your tickets in advance to avoid disappointment - http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/nomad-cinema-omen-fulham-palace-london/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Classic noir under the stars in one of London&#8217;s most impressive parks: join The Nomad Cinema for a special screening of the greatest British film of all time (discuss), The Third Man. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Classic noir under the stars, with Orson Welles as Harry Lime, one of the greatest enigmatic characters of cinema history, in what must be the greatest British film of all time. He doesn&#8217;t even pop up until halfway through the film &#8211; but, oh, what an entrance. What a beautifully shot, atmospheric setting: dark and seedy, exhausted and cynical post-war Vienna, full of smoky dens and dubious double-crossers, shades-of-grey morality and uncertain futures. A bit like Queens Park really. We invite you to join us early for some pre-film, slightly sinister jazz-noir sounds and some specially commissioned foodie treats from Anna Mae&#8217;s Southern Street Food: &#8216;The Third Mac&#8217; &#8211; delicious mac &#8216;n&#8217; cheese topped with Viennese sausage and sauerkraut. Why not wash that down with a cool Meantime Weissbier or one of Harry Lime&#8217;s Third-Man-garitas? (Ouch). If you&#8217;re looking for the inside scoop, then line up for a special shoeshine from Mr Swervy &#8211; slip him some folding money, and you might get more information than you bargained for. And be sure to dress up for our fabulous film noir photo-booth, courtesy of those kooks at Photobooth Out of Order- this is the ultimate photo-souvenir&#8230; Then pin on your limited edition Third Man badge, before settling back for some electrifying live zither music as our mystery musician treats you to that famous Anton Karas theme tune&#8230; We&#8217;re also in Queens Park on Sat 3 Sept for iconic cult comedy Napoleon Dynamite, and just up the road in Roundwood Park, we&#8217;re showing Back to the Future Part I on Sun 4 Sept. Join us for all three! PS. If you&#8217;re a Lexi Cinema member, flash your card at us at the box office and we&#8217;ll give you a shiny &#163;2 nugget back! Space is limited so please book your tickets in advance to avoid disappointment - http://www.whereisthenomad.com/events/the-third-man-open-air-cinema-queens-park/&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Tongue Fu is one of the liveliest and best-attended poetry nights in London.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Tongue Fu is one of the liveliest and best-attended poetry nights in London. The UK&#8217;s brightest stars of performance poetry and spoken word mix it up with the supremely talented Tongue Fu Band (UNKLE, Nostalgia 77, Graham Coxon) who conjure sublime soundtracks in every style imaginable. The night is built around improvisation and risk taking, coaxing poets, band and audience to take the leap into unchartered territories. Intimate, profound and often hilarious, Tongue Fu is hosted by Chris Redmond (Ventriloquist), and features Shane Solanki (Last Mango in Paris) as poet in residence. Tongue Fu is bi-monthly at Rich Mix and in 2011 will be touring the UK. Tongue Fu has also run at Glastonbury Festival, Latitude, The Big Chill, Kendal Calling and Shoreditch Festival. It works in partnership with the Roundhouse Poetry Collective, regularly hosting their brightest young poets. Past performers include Scroobius Pip, Dizraeli, Kate Tempest, Polar Bear, Ross Sutherland, Charlie Dark, Zena Edwards, Salena Godden, Inua Ellams, Michael Horovitz, Laura Dockrill, Tim Clare, Fran Landesman, Pen Ultimate, Chris Hicks, Anthony Joseph, Caroline Bird, A Poem In Between People, Byron Vincent, Luke Wright and many more.. &#8220;It&#8217;s poetry, but not as you know it&#8230;amazing to listen to&#8221; The Guardian &#8220;the best poetry night in London&#8221; WriteOutLoud.net Line up : Sept 22nd - Sabrina Mahfouz, El Crisis &amp; John Osborne hosted by Chris Redmond feat Poet In Residence Shane Solanki Nov 24th - Inua Ellams, Aoife Mannix &amp; Liv Torc hosted by Chris Redmond feat Poet In Residence Shane Solanki&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s programme addresses the transition from a digital to a post-digital culture, that looks beneath technology at how human behaviours such as collaboration, participation and interaction have redefined the creative practice and society itself, and at how the physical boundaries between reality and online are being blurred. Alpha-ville presents the 1st London Symposium of Post-digital Culture. We are joining the discourse about the post-digital era and the humanisation of digital technologies. The festival and more specifically the symposium provides a forum to exchange knowledge and inspire discussions about the future of technology, media, art and culture. Speakers confirmed so far: &#8226;Filip Visnic &#8211; Architect, Lecturer and Founder of Creative Applications Network.Net &#8226;Tom Uglow &#8211; Director of Creative Labs Europe, Google &#8226;Patrick Hussey &#8211; Digital Director at Arts &amp; Business &#8226;Mortiz Stefaner &#8211; Information Designer &#8226;Martin Ahe &#8211; Business Development at Stiktu &#8226;Keiichi Matsuda, Designer and Film-maker &#8226;Bill Thompson &#8211; Technology Writer at BBC &#8226;Drew Hemment &#8211; Director &amp; Founder of Future Everything &#8226;Katy Beale &#8211; Founder / Director at Caper Buy tickets www.alpha-ville.co.uk/tickets Part of the 2011 Alpha-ville Festival of Post-Digital Culture Alpha-ville is a London based non-profit organisation exploring the intersection between arts, technology and society.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Trafalgar Square&#8217;s Eid Festival celebrates Eid-ul-Fitr, the Islamic holiday marking the end of fasting for Ramadan. The festival will showcase a range of entertainment reflecting the diversity, culture and languages of London&#8217;s Muslim communities. The main stage will feature live folk music, rock bands, a children's choir and theatrical performances. The programme will also showcase Nasheed (from the Arabic word Anasheed) singers who draw inspiration for their work from history, religion and current affairs. Traditionally this was an a cappella music form. However the new Nasheed artists use a variety of musical instruments and sing in many languages. There will also be exhibitions of art and culture, including fun for the whole family, souvenir stalls and a chance to sample traditional Eid festive food. All are welcome to attend Eid Festival, which has grown to become one of London&#8217;s cultural highlights, attracting crowds of over 25,000 Find out more: http://www.london.gov.uk/event-meeting/2011/sep/eid-festival&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>In the world of television magic, no one has enjoyed more success than Paul Daniels.  From the moment he burst onto our screens, his magic shows have topped the ratings.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;He is undoubtedly the most successful TV magician of the 20th century (and more contraversially, an international sex symbol). He promises not to dance and will be joined by the lovely Debbie McGee and Martin Daniels. A show full of magic, comedy and amazement.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Play against the clock as a single team or if you&#8217;re after competition then challenge your mates to a cryptic race.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Until 30 October 2011 Discover London&#8217;s hidden places by solving clues sent to you by text message. How does it work? You receive a clue by text message. Solve the clue to find out where to go. Stroll, walk or dash there, work out the answer and text it back. If you get the answer right you&#8217;ll receive the next clue... and if you get stuck don&#8217;t worry you can request a hint. Play against the clock as a single team or if you&#8217;re after competition then challenge your mates to a cryptic race. The hunts last around three hours and end in a pub or bar. If you find the odd pint helps get the clue-solving juices flowing then fear not: there&#8217;s a &#8216;Bar Breaks&#8217; treasure hunt which gives you ample time to stop for drinks en route. It&#8217;s all automated so you can play any time. At &#163;8 per team, free entry to all locations and no premium text charges you can&#8217;t go far wrong. No wonder past hunters are demanding new hunts on the HiddenCity facebook page. And if you're planning a big event the people at HiddenCity can host your day for you with hosted treasure hunts including prizes. Here&#8217;s a taster clue to whet your appetite&#8230; &#8220;In Adam's fruit store on a regal street I will find many homes for peas. Who is first on the playlist?&#8221; Where would you go? Check out the HiddenCity website to find out the answer and while you&#8217;re there, sign up for a hunt!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>
