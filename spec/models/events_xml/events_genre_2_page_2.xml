  <short_description>A mix of poetry, stand-up, literature and music. HOMEWORK residents &#8211; poetry collective Aisle16 &#8211; showcase new work, alongside big name guest performers. Previous guests have included Kate Nash, Jon Ronson, and Fringe award-winner Tim Key. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;re proud to announce that our literary cabaret night returns for it's third instalment! Residents John Osborne, Tim Clare, Luke Wright, Ross Sutherland and Joe Dunthorne return for another year of vague literary ephemera. Last season ended with every audience member in the venue wearing a Tom Cruise mask, shouting out the poem from the movie Cocktail. It was our most fun night to-date, raising the bar in terms of entertainment, whilst simultaneously lowering the bar for quality of work. GOOD JOB TEAM! Season 4 runs June-November 2011. It happens on the last Wednesday of every month! 3. Wild Abandon The launch of Joe Dunthorne&#8217;s new novel, Wild Abandon, with a specially devised live reading from the book. The book follows the story of Albert and Kate, brother and sister, who are not yet the last two human beings on earth, but Albert is hopeful. Support from John Osborne and Ross Sutherland, plus an extra special guest.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;CHRIS MCCAUSLAND After a harebrained idea that went just a bit too far Chris first gave stand-up a go in the summer of 2003. In the 12 months that followed he was not only voted Jongleurs best newcomer but also achieved a top three placing in another three premier national competitions including Channel Four's "So You Think You're Funny?". He's now playing some of the top clubs in London and around the country including Jongleurs and The Comedy Store, and with his services continuing to increase in demand. Although registered blind, Chris chooses to talk only occasionally about his disability as he believes that the audience should be able to relate to as much of his material as possible. Instead his material spans from the real to the ridiculous - whether it be about university shenanigans or the all too depressing world of the giraffe&#8230; and with the odd tale of embarrassment thrown in for good measure! "An absolute natural!" - Dave Spikey (Phoenix Nights) "Shining Light!" - Sunday Express "The new face of comedy in the UK" - London Tonight, ITN "A stirling set - Elegantly written and engagingly performed" - Cho PIERRE HOLLINS Has been an audience favourite on the comedy circuit for many years, and has headlined at clubs throughout the UK, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In the early days he worked as a support act to Lenny Henry and Rory Bremner; appeared in the West End with Rita Rudner; and toured with The Flying Pickets, and Willie Rushton &amp; Barry Cryer. He has completely re-invented his act several times (from the early days of acrobatic spectacle and frivolous audience abuse - where he was described as &#8216;far fetched and semi dangerous&#8217; Time Out). In a more recent incarnation he was found weilding an electric squash racket - &#8216;must be seen to be believed&#8217; Chortle; &#8216;comedy rock and roll heaven&#8217; Hot Tickets. &#8216;An unsung hero of new comedy. Don&#8217;t miss this true professional at work. Bloody funny.&#8217; TIME OUT &#8216;A crowd favourite with a stage presence and delivery style that is the envy of many of his peers.&#8217; HONG KONG TIMES &#8216;Wild and wonderful.&#8217; VENUE &#8216;A &#8216;must see&#8217;...&#8217; THE GUARDIAN &#8216;Hugely talented, hugely experienced, comedy maestro.&#8217; KOMEDIA&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

This year they're going to break some serious ground. This year they're going to change the world.

Tonight&#8217;s performers include Andrew Watts, offering &#8220;a winning mixture of pomposity, insecurity and emotional incompetence&#8221; (Chortle); Jonny Awsum, whom the Daily Star describe as &#8220;cooler than a hypothermic Samuel L Jackson&#8221;; Sarah Hendrickx, a sharp act with a &#8220;wealth of punchy material in her arsenal&#8221; (Chortle); and the headliner, the mind-blowing Nick Helm, described as &#8220;comedy&#8217;s answer to glam rock, all swaggering machismo, aggressive posturing and energetic showmanship&#8221; by Chortle at this year&#8217;s Edinburgh Fringe. Food is available to order on the night, as well as a selection of chilled wines, delicious cocktails and cold beers on tap. We recommend you book early online to avoid disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Best of the Chrotle Awards - Shoreditch Town Hall / The Assembly Hall: 8.30pm The Chortle Awards are among the most prestigious on the comedy circuit and will be showcasing some of the brightest talent on the comedy circuit today Among the winners appearing at Shoreditch Town Hall on September 14 is one of the most familiar faces in British comedy, Kevin Eldon, winner of the best show accolade this year. His CV is a catalogue of the finest comedy films and TV programmes in recent years, including Hot Fuzz, Nighty Night, Smack The Pony, Brass Eye, Hyperdrive and Stewart Lee&#8217;s Comedy Vehicle. This fabulous show will be compered by Susan Calman, one of the fastest rising stars in comedy who was nominated as best compere this year, and will be especially well known to audiences of Radio 4&#8217;s News Quiz. She&#8217;s got an infectious bubbly manner but a caustic edge too, and both will yield comedy gold in Shoreditch this September. Kiwi comic Sam Wills, known as The Boy With Tape on His Face was the 2011 Breakthrough Act Award Winner, with an act that is now making waves on the international comedy circuit. Delightful, wry, many-layered and hilarious, The Boy With Tape on His Face transcends the barriers of language and culture. Phil Nichol: Simple Hour - Shoreditch Town Hall / Large Committee Room: 8.30pm Phil Nichol is a truly unique performer. An acclaimed actor, multi award winning comedian, producer, presenter, writer and musician there is no end to his talent. "seismically powerful award-winning comic force" (The Scotsman) Hal Cruttenden - Shoreditch Town Hall / The Mayors Parlour: 8.00pm Hal Cruttenden brings his incredible show to Shoreditch "done with high camp and nattily constructed punchlines, it definitely holds charm."(The Guardian) Michael Legge Presents Los Quattros C**ts - Shoreditch Town Hall / The Council Chamber: 8.00pm Michael Legge, Dan Mersh, Jeremy Limb and Paul Litchfield force comedic magic down the throat of a paying audience in this lovely show. Prepare to be forcibly charmed and violently tickled with sketches and laughs aplenty. These blood-thirsty scamps will certainly have you rolling for mercy in the aisles.

  <short_description>East London is set to become a destination in its own right as a result of the Olympics, and the launch of Scipmylo brings a compelling reason for people to visit this fantastic, undiscovered corner of London long after the athletes have left.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Magic &amp; Mischief with Paul Daniels, John Archer and Magical Guests - Shoreditch Town Hall / Assembly Room: 7.00pm TV Star and comedy magician Paul Daniels headlines a huge line up of magic, mystery, mirth and mischief. Daniels is one of the biggest names in the magic world and one of the most entertaining stage magicians in the UK today. Magic &amp; Mischief is also starring John Archer, winner of the 'Magic Circle Stage Magician of the Year' and one of the funniest and most talented magicians in the UK (and the go-to guy for Derren Browns parties). You'll also see Xavier Mortimer, famous in Paris for his awe inspiring illusions, witty and playful characters and theatrical musical pieces filled with flawless magic, mime and juggling. Also performing is Javier Jarquin 'The Card Ninja', who's skills with cards is inspiring, the stunts he can perform with a regular deck of cards will surprise you as he compares one of the finest magic shows London has seen this year. Tiernan Douieb : Tiernan Douieb Vs The World - Shoreditch Town Hall / Large Committee Room: 7.00pm Tiernan Douieb : Tiernan Douieb takes his comedy in a brave new direction with his new show, Tiernan Douieb Vs The World. For 30 years, Tiernan has blissfully ignored politics. Incredulous at the state of the world around him, he now finds himself on a steep political learning curve as he tackles everything from the coalition and the cuts to the burka and the Middle East. But plagued by the arguments and injustices he encounters, he wonders if ignorance might be bliss after all. He has supported Jim Jefferies, Russell Howard and worked as warm up for Mark Watson&#8217;s We Needs Answers and Dick and Dom&#8217;s Funny Business and, in 2009, invented and ran the world&#8217;s first ever Twitter Comedy Club with an estimated 14,000 viewers. Dana Alexander: New Arrival - Shoreditch Town Hall / The Mayors Parlour: 7.00pm One of Canada&#8217;s most outspoken and hilarious women is packing her bags for the UK and arriving on Edinburgh&#8217;s doorstep for a debut run at the festival this year. The only black female comedian currently on the circuit in Canada, Dana's comedic style is both refreshing and irreverent, drawing her material from her diverse lifestyle, her gay friends and her crazy Jamaican family. We are lucky enough to catch her festival debut direct from Edinburgh Fringe in London at the ScipMylo Comedy Festival. Sean Hughes - Shoreditch Town Hall / Council Chamber: 7.30pm Sean Hughes is best-known to TV audiences for his long-running stint as team captain on &#8216;Never Mind The Buzzcocks&#8217;. After an extended hiatus, Perrier award winner Hughes returns with his hugely impressive and intelligent stand up show, noted in equal measure for it's hilarity and raucous dark undercurrents. 'One of the best stand-ups of his generation' (Daily Telegraph) Carl Donnelly: Carl Donnelier - Shoreditch Town Hall / Council Chamber: 9.00pm Truly one of the UK's most up and coming comedians, Carl Donnelly comes to Shoreditch with another year's worth of tales of idiocy that critics and audiences have been flocking to see all over the UK. Two years ago, Carl was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award Best Newcomer, and this third solo show proves he is already one of the UK's finest. "Donnelly is a class act... he can squeeze a great deal of laughter out of the most mundane realities of every day existence" EDINBURGH FESTIVAL MAGAZINE Vegas Nights: The Best In Stand Up &amp; The Cuban Brothers - Shoreditch Town Hall / Assembly Hall: 9.30pm Born of the loins of seventies Havana, nurtured on a diet of soulful, sexy tunes and inspired by Cuban historical fact and mythology The Cuban Brothers deliver fresh live entertainment guaranteed to whip up a frenzy at every gig. Their legendary performance combines music, riotous comedy, and sensational dancing. 'A seriously A-list act' (The Guardian) the Cuban&#8217;s are joined by two Very Special Guests.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Ed Byrne with Kate Lucas - Shoreditch Town Hall / Assembly Hall: 7.00pm Star of Mock the Week and veteran stand-up, Irish comic superstar Ed Byrne descends upon Shoreditch with his razor sharp witticism and intelligent observations. "Byrne is at the top of his game&#8221; (The Sunday Telegraph) &#8220;Ed Byrne is a class apart" (London Evening Standard). Exploding onto the comedy scene Kate Lucas delivers a unique blend of sweet, self-deprecating humour with a dark, dry wit that resonates through her songs and playfully bitter musings on life. Andrew Maxwell - Shoreditch Town Hall / Assembly Hall: 9.30pm Andrew continues to dominate the live and festival circuits. Notable appearances have included several sell-out shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, The Amnesty / Channel Four Secret Policeman's Ball (alongside Eddie Izzard, Chevy Chase and Dylan Moran, The HBO US Comedy &amp; Arts Festival in Las Vegas (alongside Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock), several sell-out runs in the main house of London's Soho Theatre, Kilkenny Cat Laughs Festival, Glastonbury and the Montreal Just for Laughs Festival.

  <short_description>Straight from his last sold out tour, James Mullinger comes to his hometown with a brand new hour of the hilarious and insightful anecdote based stand up.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Straight from his last sold out tour, James Mullinger comes to his hometown with a brand new hour of the hilarious and insightful anecdote based stand up that has made him one of the most popular comedians on the international circuit and led the Evening Standard to describe him as "something of a sensation". Mullinger began his stand up career in 2004 and then stormed the Just For Laughs festival in Montreal in 2005 and 2006. Since then, he has been seen performing with Jimmy Carr on his DVD 'Stand Up' (Carr describes Mullinger as "a great stand up") and also alongside Robin Ince and Rufus Hound on panel show Street Cred Sudoku. His first tour about his life as a male feminist 'The Bad Boy Of Feminism' was Pick Of The Week in both The Guardian and The Sunday Times Culture and was described by Shappi Khorsandi as "fast paced, intelligent and very very funny" and by Iain Morris (creator of The Inbetweeners) as "hernia inducingly funny". The Guardian recently described Mullinger as "one to watch" and the Mail On Sunday commented that "At the heart of this raw show lie some serious points". It's an hour of pure, unadulterated stand up and stories from Mullinger's unique life. Be sure to book early &#8211; his last show at The Exhibit sold out in days.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>From Louise Roche, the writier of 'Girls' Night' and 'Where the Heart Is'.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Barbara has just survived an eventful 'significant' birthday, which has got her thinking for the first time about the benefits of big pants and Botox. If you have to empty your bladder before joining the kids on the trampoline, it's a few years since you've had an uninterrupted view of your feet and in your vocabulary the word piles doesn't have to be followed by the word 'of', then you'll be amused and even comforted by this hilarious, emotional and uplifting new play. Warning: Do not watch with a full bladder.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>
