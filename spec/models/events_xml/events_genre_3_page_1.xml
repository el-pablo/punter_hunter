  <short_description>Celebrating 13 Years of the RVT&#8217;s CHILL-OUT
Back to back RVT anthems from the DJs Simon Le Vans, Andy Almighty &amp; Sean Sirrs. 2pm &#8216;til Midnight. The genius of The D. E. Experience (aka Jonathan Hellyer) on stage after sports day with a special show.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;S.L.A.G.S/CHILL-OUT is the amazingly popular Sunday afternoon and Bank Holiday Monday sessions. Always packed to the rafters every week with an amazing 'no attitude', sexy and fun crowd. Come along and you'll see why it remains Vauxhall's longest running (and busiest) gay event! The day kicks off at 2pm with SIMON LE VANS (Gaydar Radio) playing current house tunes. Taking to the stage at 5.30pm is our resident superstar cabaret THE D. E. EXPERIENCE. The CHILL-OUT then takes over at 7pm with DJ ANDY ALMIGHTY (7th Heaven/Almighty) playing uplifting commercial house, party anthems and mixes you won&#8217;t hear anywhere else. The disco rocks through &#8216;til midnight with DJ SEAN SIRRS (Love Muscle) at 9.30pm, taking it tougher &#8216;til close. On the Sundays before a Bank Holiday we throw a special event with an extension until the early hours with a guest DJ. End your weekend on a fantastic high, get to the RVT this (and every) Sunday and Bank Holiday for the biggest party in town. Useful tip! Sundays and Bank Holidays at the RVT can be extremely busy. To ensure you do get in pre-show, it is wise to arrive before 4pm. Entry &#163;8, &#163;5 after 7pm Early Bird Drinks Vouchers before 4.30pm Outside bar to 10pm&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

First of all it's about dub music. We want to share the dub and offer a new stage for as many artists as possible, promoting specifically UK dub reggae producers, singers and sound systems. Its about dub culture too, as a way of life and as a living tradition. About sharing a meal, entertaining with stall vendors, ones dancing on with their own vibe and riddim. The Dubwise Festival is also a way to express and to spread a message nourished by the world's history, by Caribbean inspiration and by the wisdom of rastafarism. A message of thanksgiving, of respect and of peace delivered by the older generation. Dubwise is also a scream at today's music industry. The Dubwise Festival stands for the development of our music and artists and for the organisation of our business in a professional and fair way. We don't only want to help artists to broadcast and diffuse their music but also help them to protect their musical expression for their own career development. The Dubwise Festival was initiated in 2009 by Young Warrior, the mighty son of Jah Shaka, in order to promote this music, this culture and this message. Established by the help of sought funding as a non profit organisation, The Dubwise Festival try to retain the old school reggae community vibes as a result of the fact that the night has been created by the people for which it promotes. Come get a feel of the vibe and the tradition of dub, also to support a new generation of artists. This Festival is an open door that welcomes both new and experienced listeners of dub/reggae music alike, We may have different colour skin, but the same colour of soul, We may have different origins or roots, but the same goals, Standing together to build a better world, Living it up united in a spirit of celebration.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Shed returns from its festival frolics to take over Bloomsbury Lanes once again.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Well strike me down and bowl me over! After smashing the best parties in festival-land and the streets of East London, the Disco Shed Soundsystem heads back inside at the Bloomsbury Lanes. The shed&#8217;s gnomes hate missing out on fun, so we will be bringing a bit of the shed&#8217;s festival charm to London, with hula-hoops, giant twister, and of course, some of the most impressive and bulbous gardening tools known to man. Alan Titchmarsh&#8217;s semi-stiff spade handle this is not. And if that&#8217;s too hot to handle, simply enjoy a boogie, bowl or karaoke while resident shed DJs Jason &#8220;The Cat&#8221; King, DJ BarryDark and head-of-shed, Peepshow Paddy drop dancefloor-heavy party classics from across the board to remind you that you don&#8217;t have to be at a festival to hear block rockin&#8217; beats as good as this. www.facebook.com/discoshed // www.twitter.com/discoshed&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Come Together concept proved its mettle last summer and are back for their Friday night placement for 12 dates with awesome parties based on the idea of mixing a wide variety of electronic music genres and awesome live performances.
</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Safehouse Management is happy to announce the line up for COME TOGETHER 2011, making it official that Friday nights at Space Ibiza are going to kick the Ibiza club scene into high gear yet again. The COME TOGETHER concept proved its mettle last summer with awesome parties based on the idea of mixing a wide variety of electronic music genres and awesome live performances under one roof at the club DJ Mag readers voted as Number 1 in the world. Safehouse Management says this year&#8217;s party program is going to take the bar even higher. And clubbers from around the world are not the only ones flocking to Space Ibiza on Friday nights. COME TOGETHER has also won the hearts of today&#8217;s biggest electronic music artists including Chase &amp; Status, De La Soul, Faithless Soundsystem, Katy B, Kelis, Magnetic Man, Pendulum, Tinie Tempah and more. Safehouse Management, who organises the event, has also collaborated with Boysnoize Records, Bedrock Records &amp; Viva Music to create the hottest nights featuring the best artists. Only in its second year and COME TOGETHER has firmly established itself as one of the top nights for showcasing the latest trends and megastars of the electronic music scene. And the beauty is: Everyone&#8217;s invited! Discoteca: Tinie Tempah (Full Live Band), Pendulum (EL Hornet DJ Set) &amp; MC A.D Covered Terrace: Special Guests TBA Sunset Terrace: Push Push presents Elio Riso + friends Red Box: hosted by Future Disco: Ian Blevins, Faze Action (DJ Set) Coming together is not just a name. It&#8217;s a vision. If you pick a name like COME TOGETHER you can&#8217;t afford to leave anybody out of the loop. On the contrary, you have to make sure your party is top of everyone&#8217;s A-list and then you have to open your doors wide enough so they all feel welcome. Safehouse Management has the experience and vision to make that happen. No doubt, they are also fired up by last year&#8217;s success with massive nights and overwhelmingly positive reviews. Whatever the secret, their line-up speaks for itself with live performers including British producers Chase &amp; Status whose explosive sound is guaranteed to blast the PA system; legendary US hip-hop group, De La Soul, well known for seriously rocking the house; Faithless Soundsystem, who will be calling all the faithful back to Space once again for three exclusive gigs; British chart-topping dynamo Katy B, performing with a live band; award winning Kelis, whose new album Flesh Tone is getting top recognition; Magnetic Man, the British dubstep trio of Skream, Benga and Artwork; frenetic Australian megastars Pendulum; and also Tinie Tempah, whose song Pass Out has just been announced as the "Best Contemporary Song" at this year&#8217;s Ivor Novello Awards. Add to that a list of essential DJs with insane amounts of creativity and crowd-pleasing energy and it&#8217;s easy to understand why COME TOGETHER might just become a blueprint for the future of clubbing. It probably doesn&#8217;t hurt that this all takes place on the sunkissed island of Ibiza in a club known for its spectacular sound and light system, indoor/outdoor dance environment and down-to-earth entry prices.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Conscious reggae for rootikal people</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday 2nd of September Rootikal welcomes back Nick Manasseh and roots legend Errol Bellot to the basement at East Village. Nick goes back to the early days of Kiss FM, when the show he hosted was essential listening for all musical tribes. Alongside the likes of Russ Disciple and Conscious Sounds he spearheaded the new sound of the UK reggae in the late 80s and early 90s. Nick remains in-demand as both a producer - check out the releases on Roots Garden for a flavour of what he's been up to - and also as a mix engineer for others wanted that dynamic, heavy sound for their tracks. It's always a lovely set from Nick, so we're very happy to have him back. Errol has been on the UK roots scene for 30 years, starting with 'The Wicked Them', his first release, which he recorded and produced for the Militant label. He went on to record the roots anthem 'Babylon' for S&amp;G, plus a number of digi killers for Jah Tubbys, the sound he often sings on (check out 'Sound Ina Fury' and 'Rastafari Is The Way'). It's our pleasure to have him back for a PA. The Rootikal crew of David Hill, Stuart Patterson and Mr Faso will also be spinning in the basement alongside guest selector Sweetie, and Prince Terralox will be holding the mic. www.rootikal.net&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>After another sell out at The Whitehouse, ExiT has time to squeeze in one more night before they fly off for their Ibiza Tour. Returning home to where it all began, they will be bringing the full ExiT show to Inigo Bar once again</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;So after filling the Whitehouse to the rafters for our Ibiza tour launch, we are cramming in 1 more party before we jet off to warmer climates. On Friday 2nd of September we launch the start of our new monthly residency as we return to where ExiT very first started smashing the dancefloor. After a recent incarnation as Tonki Gorilla, Inigo Bar has reinvented itself to recapture its former glory as London's most famous award winning DJ Bar. We will be bringing the full ExiT showpiece to Lavender Hill for our Ibiza warm-up, and rekindling some of that Whitehouse magic, with the return of EFAS and Diego Hererra. Also joining us for the 2nd time after his roof raising debut will be Dr Yes, with his freshly acquired PHD, in feel good house. Inigo has one of the most intense yet relaxed atmospheres of all the venues we have played, and this will be no different. The sound system is simply amazing, which will be complimented by the now infamous ExiT soundtrack carved out by sublime vocals and thundering baselines. DJ's G.O.D Daisy Diggler EFAS Diego Hererra Dr Yes Full details Entrance - Free B4 10pm, &#163;5 on guestlist all night, More on door For more details party bookings, and guestlist Contact - Chris - 07739961019 exitnight@hotmail.co.uk www.exitnight.co.uk Keep 01 October in your diary, as we will be returning fresh from our Ibiza tour with another equally intense lineup.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Point Blank with Tomeki Temura (Holic) and Bounce Back take a floor each
this ones all about House!</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Point Blank label night returns for its monthly residency at The Disco Pub AKA The Horse &amp; Groom!- Pure Quality House Music Tomoki Tamura- Stepping up this time is former student Tomoki Tamura, of reputable Bristol label, Four:Twenty. Tomoki has played at clubs around the world from Fabric and Ministry of Sound in London, to 'Womb' in Tokyo, where his hugely successful club night, Holic has it&#8217;s own residency. Tomoki is easily one of the most successful Japanese DJs in the world. Now residing in London, Tomoki has brought his brand of Deep House to the UK with his 2008 release &#8211; being charted number 1 on the Beatport Deep House chart. Enjoying residencies at top clubs like 'The End' in London and frequently playing at superclubs around Europe from Madrid and Berlin to Turkey &amp; Greece, Tomoki has stormed many a dancefloor. We eagerly anticipate a cracking set from yet another Point Blank success story! Carlotek- Resident DJ and label co-ordinator, Carlotek steps up to provide us with the usual blend of quality House music. Carlotek is currently enjoying DJ support on his forthcoming Point Blank release &#8216;Uplifter&#8217;, from Scottish Techno Lords Slam, Nico De Ceglia (MOS), Paco Osuna (Minus), 2020 Vision&#8217;s MoodyManc and many more. Carlotek's trademark is a fusion of live Flamenco guitar and House music, what he calls Flamencotek. Last year his release Rosario, featured his father, international flamenco guitarist Juan Martin. The track enjoyed support and airplay from the cr&#232;me de la cr&#232;me, with Roger Sanchez, Dubfire, Chris Lake, Ministry of Sound Radio and The Galaxy Network all jumping on board to get behind it. Carlotek is no stranger to the decks either, racking up DJ sets at top London venues such as 93 Feet East, Public Life &amp; The Egg. He plays tracks with melody and avoids excessive repetition, a trap many a House DJ fall into. His sets present a dynamic between intensive bursts of 4/4 energy followed by contrasting laidback Deep House grooves. Bounce Back...pure house vibes with a deep underground twist! House music has been split into many different genres over the last couple of years with many promoters dedicating their parties to one specific sound! We are different! Our parties create an original house atmosphere whilst maintaining strong links to the underground scene that the capital is famous for. If you love the vibe, and sound of real house music but don&#8217;t find it easily accessible in and around London, then this is a night you will not want to miss! We shall be starting our musical journey at the much loved Shoreditch hot spot, The Horse &amp; Groom. Situated on the quieter end of Curtain Rd. The venue and its location gives us the perfect opportunity to showcase our unique blend of the underground sounds whilst still having the freedom to bring original house cuts to the masses.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Clouds - Turbo Recordings - will be making their way down from the Scottish highlands to bring their unique sound to the partygoers of East London. After smashing releases out on labels such as Blood Music and Turbo Recording, we expect nothing less than pure unadulterated filth from this duo. Fake Blood championed their early tracks and they've remixed big names like Dem Slackers,The Proxy and The Subs. Back-up comes from Lemmy Ashton (Snap, Crackle &amp; Pop), Jean Reno (Skanky Skanky) and our very own GETDOWNORDIE DJ crew. If you were there last time, you know this is not to be missed.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Beat Unique shares the Flomotion ethos and it&#8217;s unblinking belief in new generation forward-thinking music and we hope to share it with you too&#8230; Facebook event page: http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=265167343500149 Join the Beat Unique facebook group: http://www.facebook.com/groups/117264921620137/ See www.beatunique.com and www.flomotionradio.com for more details. Echaskech are a London based electronic act composing emotive, melodic and powerful music. Echaskech are: Andy Gillham, Dom Hoare, Mach V (Visuals). Their sound is derived from numerous influences ranging across techno, dubstep, IDM, acid crunk and drum and bass. Signed to Just Music alongside diverse acts such as Jon Hopkins, Leo Abrahams and Dan Arborise, they present a unique take on electronic music with warm chord progressions, low end sub bass and cheeky melodies combining to form an accessible yet original style of production. &#8220;Echaskech display proficiency very much akin to the likes of Apparat, Ellen Allien, Modeselektor&#8221; &#8211; Drowned in Sound. They have collaborated with and remixed numerous acts including Roots Manuva, James Yuill, Max Cooper, Kraddy, Posthuman and SBTRKT with festival performances at Glade, Blissfields, Secret Garden Party, Solfest, Deershed, Big Chill and Festinho to name but a few. Earlier this year, they performed at a Just Music Cafe showcase at Palac Akropolis in Prague, alongside labelmates Digitonal and Marconi Union. Their previous two albums Skechbook (Just Music 2007) and Shatterproof (Just Music 2009) are essential record collection must haves and have received much praise from the music press. On Shatterproof: &#8221;This is an album of original material superbly executed and guaranteed to appeal.&#8221; 5/5 &#8211; Utterly Fantastic! &#8211; I-DJ Magazine &#8220;One of the albums of the year. Phenomenal. Electronica at its very best &#8211; think Orbital meets Jon Hopkins with a bit of Schnauss thrown in for good measure.&#8221; Ben Mynott (Fluid Nation, Big Chill). Currently working on their third album, Echaskech are lining up a further delivery of heavy crunking bass and melody led electronics. Expect great things at their Ginglik gig. As well as previewing new material from their third album, Echaskech have a few great surprises up their sleeves. Not to be missed! www.echaskech.co.uk www.soundcloud.com/echaskech www.myspace.com/echaskech www.discogs.com/artist/Echaskech Subeena is the name by which London-based artist Sabina Plamenova gives vent to her soulful, intensely engaging experiments in electronic music. Initially linked with the Dubstep scene, Subeena&#8217;s music quickly outgrew this category, combining elements of other genres as it evolved with a subtlety and intelligence that revealed her passion for complexity and experimentation, though still with a keen ear for the dancefloor. Her music is undeniably unique, almost alien in feeling, while remaining firmly listenable. Her tracks seem to contain a blend of different influences that is difficult to unpick into its individual ingredients &#8211; perhaps a result of the 24-year-old&#8217;s frequent relocations, from Turin, to Berlin, before finally coming to rest in the UK&#8217;s capital &#8211; itself an important meeting-point for sound and culture. Her tracks have been played numerous times by the internationally renowned trendsetter Mary Anne Hobbs, on her weekly BBC Radio 1 show presenting experimental electronic music, recognised as playing an important part in the massive growth of Dubstep at the beginning of 2006. Mary Anne also devoted a part of her special one-off female producer showcase to Subeena, along with other musical innovators such as Cooly G and Ikonika, who have recently been receiving considerable media attention Subeena recently peformed as part of `Nick Luscombe Presents&#8230;&#8217; at Spitalfields Music Summer Festival night at Village Underground. She left us so transfixed that we just had to invite her back to perform another outstanding set at our next night! www.myspace.com/subeena www.opitrecords.bandcamp.com www.soundcloud.com/subeena www.soundcloud.com/opitrecords DJ Nick Luscombe Respected from all corners of the music world, Nick Luscombe is one of the UK&#8217;s most exciting and influential radio and club DJs.

Nick is a presenter of `Late Junction&#8217;, the Sony award winning thrice weekly radio show on BBC Radio 3. Nick Luscombe&#8217;s unblinking belief in new, forward-thinking music has constantly won him new fans. Nick&#8217;s trademark sets represent a feast of musical styles, each a one-off and tailor made for the night. His eclectic deep club sounds blend deep and minimal house with electronica, broken beat, jazz, dubstep, techno, soul, disco and hip hop and even a few Brazilian classics.

  <short_description>DiscoPhobia is launching its first night under a new name in one of our favourite venues - The Horse and Groom on Curtain Road. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Disco Pub" as its affectionately called in Clubland circus have been a home to our previous 2 parties. It needs no introduction - with its traditional quirky exterior, fitted with a state of art sound system - it is an exceptional party venue known for a great music and a friendly vibe. And there is no better way to celebrate our new re launch and would have been Love Asylum's 3rd birthday then with a bunch of friends and welcome guests. Our special guest for the night is Claire Ripley (Desous/Murmur) joining her on decks on the night is another talented female DJ who graced our decks several times before - Monika Ross (Uberbeat) with further support from both Tomee and RiK - our residents and a part of Love Asylum/DiscoPhobia family. Claire Ripley Over the past 3 years Claire has stormed in to the House and Techno scene with an array of stunning releases with her first major E.P getting signed to Steve Bug's highly respected imprint Dessous Recordings. Becoming a regular feature on the label she not only showcases her original work but also remixing for the Dessous Best Kept Secrets Release. With 2010 being a big year for Claire she went on to also feature for several other labels such as Neurotraxx, Dogmatik Records and London based Murmur having her huge hit 'Slow Loris' remixed by Solomun which gained respect and plays from none other than Richie Hawtin. 2011 sees Claire pushing the same tempo with a strong output of releases on Gorge's Katchuli and 1Trax including a remix of Robert Owens - I'll Be Your Friend and Dogmatik as well as sets at nights like Circo Loco in Maidstone and WetYourSelf at fabric. Away from having her tracks signed to some of the worlds biggest labels she is also the head of Phobic Records which is pushing its 17th release as they move in to 2011. Since the labels start in 2008 it has showcased some of the best international artists in the scene with the likes of Tim Green, Chris Lattner, Ekkohaus, Alex Arnout and Inxec. The work that has featured on the label over the years has seen massive support from top DJ's worldwide from the likes of Seth Troxler, Dubfire, Carl Cox, Magda, Slam, Steve Lawler, Simon Baker, Laurent Garnier, Matt Tolfrey, Nic Fanciulli, Gabriel Ananda and more. http://soundcloud.com/csripley Monika Ross- Originating from Sydney, Monika has been engulfed in the electronic music scene since 2000. Being at the forefront of underground deep and tech house she began establishing a name for herself playing at intimate clubs involved with Sydney's intricate scene. It was during this time that Monika got involved in radio and landed a slot hosting and producing `Frequency&#8217;, FBI Radio&#8217;s Friday night electronic show. Fresh on the scene both behind the decks and on the air her innovative style and approach to broadcasting proved to have an infectious effect on her listeners both on the air and in the clubs. Since residing in London in 2008, she soon established herself within London&#8217;s growing music scene. The east&#8217;s magnetic culture along with the discovery of ambitious London artists and Labels proved to be a substantial influence on her music. Monika Ross&#8217;s mixing style is marked by deep, percussive and diverse sounds with soulful bass lines and unique vocal elements.http://soundcloud.com/monika-ross Tomee (Love Asylum/DiscoPhobia)-Tomas Karkalas aka Tomee have always had strong affinity for music. His first major exposure to electronic music was through his introduction to Sutemos.net netlabel, a mixture of ldm/ambient/dub/techno sound and in particularly Intelligent Toys compilations caused a dependence on sound that later in life grew into severe addiction. Tom's introduction to large scale raves happened when he set his foot in London with his introduction to warehouse parties and big clubs . But it was Fabric that had a major influence on his evolving music taste. That was the place where he spent endless hours lost in sounds realizing that the only spot in the club he would want to be the most was DJ booth. Tom's condition has worsened and Fabric was to blame on his decision to buy his first pair of decks. This was a point of no return. Currently a student of SAE and future sound engineer Tom found himself exactly in place where he imagined - DJ booth. Besides having started his DJing career relatively recently he already found himself playing in Bar Sia, loft of MOS, but also Aquarium and CAMP in East London. Tom's music style is diverse from minimalistic groovy housy stuff to underground, deep, hypnotic and broken beat techno with producers like Surgeon, Lucy, Marcel Dettman, but also Seth Troxler, Martin Buttrich and Villalobos being his major influence. Tom is currently a resident for Love Asylum and DiscoPhobia.http://soundcloud.com/tomee_dp&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Jamm Presents&#8230; continue their run of incredible in house programmed events with Hybrid Soundsystem headlining with an incredible DJ set like they only know how, alongside Dave Spoon, plus some amazing support from About the Beat and Shebang.

</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Being able to witness the powerful beats of Hybrid up close and personal is an opportunity that does not happen very often. The Hybrid Soundsystem is a step up from the Hybrid DJ sets of old. Backed by regular releases from their new Kill City label plus a portable backline of keys, sampler and laptop, Chris Healings is finally able to deliver the club sets Hybrid have always wanted to. Their distinctive electronic progressive breaks sound will be accompanied by a creative and genre crossing vibe produced via Hybrid Soundsystem and smash a great big hole in Jamms dancefloor. Hybrid are one of the most forward thinking and technically skilled acts in electronic dance music. Blurring the line between in-studio production and live presentation, Hybrid are one of the few remaining dance acts to perform live with a classic band setup. Hybrid have produced four amazing albums since they broke onto the scene in 1999 with what is now a classic in &#8220;Wide Angle&#8221;. With the most recent album also welcoming a new member in singer songwriter Charlotte James to work alongside founder member Chris Healings and Mike Truman, they have shown that they are always looking to develop their sound with this recent album taking a more traditional approach to songwriting than in previous albums. Jamm have not stopped there as they have Dave Spoon, who will be using his years of experience at the top of the dance music game to rock the Jamm house. Having released underground and crossover hits alike on some of the best dance music labels around, plus being part of the Radio 1 &#8220;In New DJs We Trust&#8221; show, highlights the levels this great producer and DJ has been playing at. Over two rooms, this Saturday night will be packed with some amazing musical DJ talent. Accompanying the headline acts in the main room will be About the Beat. Producing a monthly Music &amp; Culture Newsletter with events, reviews, interviews, mix&#8217;s, industry tickets and give aways About the Beat support the London scene by promoting great music, supporting upcoming artists and generally getting busy spreading the love that is electronic music. There residents will be on hand to show what they are all about. Shebang will be in control of the Front Room. This Female Federation of House regularly pull out all the stops to deliver a party that makes you remember why you fell in love with clubbing! With an array of all female DJs smashing the beats throughout the night, there is no doubt the both rooms will have clubbers swinging from the rafters from start to finish.

  <short_description>Sat 3rd Sept we keep up with the standard of line-ups and invite Djuma Soundsystem (Get Physical), Alex Picone &amp; Mirko Loko (Cadenza Vagabundos)</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Come and join us for our next massive installment as key of Life proves that the London club scan is very much alive and kicking with friendly people &amp; quality Dance music. Along side the special guests, our raw London talented Dj&#8217;s that never fail to deliver quality sets, great energy &amp; good vibes from behind the decks. Inviting Key Of Life Home Grown Artist&#8217;s &#8216;Chloe Fontaine&#8217; sibling of the famous &#8216;Seb Fontaine&#8217; proving that music does run through veins! &#8216;Irtelli &amp; Gus&#8217; with releases through &#8216;Love Hertz&#8217; &#8216;No1 Beatport&#8217; Success &amp; Known for their seriously rolling Sets..&#8217;Delgado&#8217; that eats, sleeps in the studio constantly turning out new releases for label like Definitive Rec // No Logik Records // Cinetque Records // Funkinyou // Killing Machine to name a few. DJUMA SOUNDSYSTEM Norwegian DJ &amp; producer Mikkas is flying the Djuma Soundsystem flag solo these days. The spirit of production and DJ style remains the same. That trademark of warm beats and melodies is alive and well both in the studio and on the road. The sound is between tech house, house, disco, and techno, with a lot of personality and humanity involved. Djuma Soundsystem had a major radio and club hit with "Les Djinns" (the single biggest selling track on beatport.com) and has proved to be much more than a one off, with releases like "This sound", "Atilla", "Small fries", "Zillion lights", "Bipolar", "Blizzard" and "Stoli", on well known indie labels, like Get Physical, Rebirth, Soundz, IO and Tool Room. They have been remixed by Uner, Tiger Stripes, Trentem&#248;ller, Martinez &amp; Moby, to name but a few and Djuma Soundsystems music has been charted and supported by all the major tech house DJ's. ALEX PICONE Italian-born Alex Picone&#8217;s passion for deep analogue-sounding grooves is all consuming. Ever since he was a teenager, his whole life has been devoted to feeling, sharing and shaping hip-rolling house + techno. And, of course, it shows. Whether he&#8217;s laying it down at top Italian clubs like Flow and il Muretto, or blasting it out in Berlin where he&#8217;s now based, his ego-free approach to DJing attracts true underground party heads in droves. MIRKO LOKO Swiss-born DJ/producer Mirko Loko has been doing his thing for more than a decade. Dispensing sounds that take shape at an invigorating intersection between Detroit-inspired techno and the subtle stripped-down side of house. As a DJ, he&#8217;s played Detroit Electronic Music Festival, Miami WMC, Circoloco in Ibiza, Sven V&#228;th&#8217;s Cocoon Club in Frankfurt and the best clubs in Berlin, while recent productions include an EP on Loco Dice&#8217;s Desolat imprint and a solo album on Luciano&#8217;s Cadenza. Conveying a musical chemistry with the coolest of credentials &#8211; welcome to Mirko Loko&#8217;s world.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Oliver Lang http://www.soundcloud.com/&#8203;oliver-lang It&#8217;s been another top year for DJ, Producer and Label Owner Oliver Lang With tracks out on leading labels Toolroom, Spinnin &amp; Blackhole, his continuing legendary residency with Bora Bora in Ibiza and two new residencies with Gatecrasher and Perverted Audio, combined with dates all over the globe and for leading venues including Sankeys Manchester, Honey Club Brighton, Versuz Belgium, Matter London and Privilege Ibiza. Ant Brooks http://soundcloud.com/antb&#8203;rooksmusic As 2011 develops, anticipate only bigger and better from an artist whose discography already boasts releases on Starlight, 303Lovers, Spinnin, Strictly Rhythm, Size and Toolroom Records respectively. This is not only an example of Ant&#8217;s extraordinary progression, but a fact that cries out that Ant Brooks is undoubtedly one of house music&#8217;s future stars.

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;UPSTAIRS: DJs playing classic guitar cuts from then &#8216;til now, joining the musical dots between the Stones, Smiths &amp; Strokes, etc. Five Working Days (Live @ 11.15) - A super-catchy quintet of brass-tinted indie with punchy rhythms and a triple vocal attack. Already given a thumbs-up by XFM, winning their unsigned band of the month campaign and playing the XFM stage at the Metro Ski Show. Fab MayDay (Urban Club, Perugia) - Since running his first night "Disco 2000" in 2004, Fab is now resident DJ and art director of "Friday I'm in Rock" (Urban Club, Perugia), "Italo Italians" and "I hate 80's". With his love of mixing genres from 80's to Motown, from rockabilly to nu disco. After playing his mixes across countless clubs in Europe he is now here to show what he can do. Rock Hunter (International Hi-Fi) - Although nowadays a resident on the Rock floor of Smoke &amp; Mirrors, Mr Hunter is happy to return to his indie roots for Casino Royale! DOWNSTAIRS: It&#8217;s a riot of 60s garage, northern soul, psychedelia from: Eddie Piller (Acid Jazz / Q Radio) - Ed is the sharp-suited man behind the acid jazz records and plays a pivotal part in London's thriving mod scene. He's played around the globe and continues to broadcast for 6 music and q radio, where he unearths psychedelic gems and classic northern soul. Expect only the best in dancefloor-orientated 60's tunes. Plus, flamboyant host Victor de Milo hands out his own bank notes so that everyone can have a free go on our "Monte Carlo-style Roulette table", with the chance to win drinks!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Electronic adventurers The Centrifuge return to their spiritual home of East London after myriad excursions around the festivals, warehouses and dancefloors of Europe and North America over the summer.
</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Cursor Miner is the avant pop anti-hero who continues to confound expectations, sport outlandish costumes and shatter genre preconceptions with his barnstorming live show. His last album on Uncharted Audio was a veritable tour de force straddling the line between perfectly crafted vocal pop and cerebral dancefloor electronics. Having torn the roof down at The Centrifuge's 3rd Birthday Party in Berlin last year we are delighted to welcome him back for a romp in his home territory. Did Debasser really start the whole UK bass scene? You better believe it, when his critically-acclaimed release on NovaMute "Fat Girls" came out it caused a ruckus and endless inspirants, imitations and countless sub-genres. Having just released a new single "The Tingler" on his own WIDE Records, this is his first live outing for The Centrifuge and the excitement is already building to hear those basslines on that PA. Electro-pop noizenik Rival Consoles has just released his landmark 2nd album on Erased Tapes Records with an innovative viral campaign seeing each track released separately over a number of weeks. Now the album's out! Listen, enjoy, then come and rave. Vaetxh is a fast-rising star of bass and glitch. Having been discovered by The Centrifuge in 2010, his heady mix of laser-precision audio manipulation and body-spasmic bass frequency workouts is winning him fans across the globe. Not least record label bosses, who are queuing up to sign him. Come hear (and feel) what all the fuss is about! Gareth Clarke is a master of melody like no other. Combining compositional virtuosity with dancefloor sensibility it's no wonder why he is harbouring an impressive and growing legion of admirers comprised of the great and the good of forward-thinking electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

You need JavaScript enabled to view it Info Line: +44 (0) 7956 472 558 *************************** Safe And Friendly Environment London's No.1 Psy Trance Clubbing Night Out Full On Sound System Plus Amazing Lasers &amp; Lights The Venue Has A Roof Terrace For Smokers Plus A Chill Out Area To Relax &amp; Cafe! *************************** Red Dust&#8230; (English) "Red Dust" project began as three friends Celia (Zel X), Fran (Frankie Lord Flames) and Mar&#237;a (Malorie Psy) who wanted to translate Fran &amp; Mar&#237;a&#8217;s experience into the world of Trance music in London, where they both were living for a year and loved the idea of the trance atmosphere there. Open to all audiences of all nationalities and ethnicities... Thus was born "Red Dust" in October 2010, when they returned to Spain, they were going to miss not only the parties, but what they felt in themselves, the people they met, and the feelings they had... As is well known there is a shortage of Psy trance in Spain especially in Seville. Their goal has been to this change and that beautiful souls from different cultures could dance to psychedelic rhythms and find the ecstasy. Of course surrounded with good people, nature and decoration to take everybody to new worlds&#8230; They began the project and wanted to open trance to everyone mixing Seville and London, UK and Spain, bringing DJs from U.K. and doing a line up together with Spanish artists, so they can have a small piece of the environment that we yearn for&#8230; Red Dust currently has the privilege of being considered one of the strongest collective trance outfits of the national scene in Spain, Their motto is "connection" between the UK and Spain, connection between different types of audiences. Connecting to the land, "Red Dust"... Red Dust&#8217;s adventure in London with &#8220;Cohesion&#8221; is a Big step in the right direction. It&#8217;s their first step of the Spain and UK journey and it will not be the last! *************************** (Spanish) &#8220;Red Dust&#8221; comenz&#243; siendo el proyecto de tres amigos: Celia (Zel X), Fran (Frankie Lord Flames) y Mar&#237;a (Malorie Psy) que quisieron trasladar la experiencia en el mundo del Trance de estos dos &#250;ltimos (Frankie Lord Flames y Malorie) en Londres, donde estuvieron viviendo un a&#241;o y quedaron prendados del ambiente trance de all&#237;, abierto a todo tipo de p&#250;blico, de todas las nacionalidades y &#233;tnias callejeras&#8230; As&#237; naci&#243; &#8220;Red Dust&#8221; en octubre de 2.010, cuando todos est&#225;bamos ya de nuevo en Espa&#241;a y pensamos que &#237;bamos a echar de menos, no s&#243;lo las fiestas, sino lo que sent&#237;amos en ellas, la gente que conocimos, etc&#8230; Por todos es conocida la escasez de Psytrance en Espa&#241;a y aun m&#225;s en Sevilla, nuestro objetivo ha sido que esto cambiara y que las almas bellas de diferentes culturas pudieran danzar al son de ritmos psicod&#233;licos y encontrar el &#233;xtasis, rodeados por supuesto de buenas personas, naturaleza y decoraci&#243;n que nos lleve a nuevos mundos. Y empezamos un proyecto con el que pretend&#237;amos abrir el Trance a todo el mundo y subgrupos urbanos, mezclando Londres con Sevilla, U.K. con Espa&#241;a, trayendo DJs de U.K. y haciendo un line up conjunto con nuestros artistas espa&#241;oles&#8230; Y as&#237; poder tener tambi&#233;n cerca un cachito de la tierra, la gente y el ambiente que tanto a&#241;oramos. Actualmente tenemos el privilegio de estar considerados uno de los colectivos de Trance m&#225;s fuertes de la escena nacional en Espa&#241;a, siendo nuestro lema" la conexi&#243;n": entre U.K. y Espa&#241;a, conexi&#243;n entre diferentes tipos de p&#250;blico, etc... Conexi&#243;n con la tierra, el "Polvo Rojo"... Y creo que con nuestra aventura en Londres junto con Cohesion, lo hemos conseguido. No ser&#225; la &#250;nica vez, ya que &#233;ste es s&#243;lo el primer paso de nuestra andadura en U.K. buscando el mestizaje y la fusi&#243;n entre Espa&#241;a y U.K.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most recognisable brands in club world is coming to BCM, the largest club in Mallorca. Cream will host their own special events throughout the season, bringing with them their outstanding production flare and party prowess. Closing out the Cream season at BCM in style will be a one last blow out with Super You &amp; Me man Laidback Luke. Laidback Luke, a sensational electro house DJ from the Netherlands, has remixed David Guetta and Tara McDonald&#8217;s track &#8220;Delirious&#8221; and cooperated with Swedish House Mafia on the ultimate club hit &#8220;Leave the World Behind&#8221;. He runs his own colourful parties at various clubs throughout the year and is captivating the scene like nobody else. Luke and his superhuman fusion of hyper drive housestep and ghettojack trancebass have catapulted to exasperating new heights over the last couple of years. With all BCM&#8217;s insane production, VIP area, lights, canons and laser, it&#8217;s sure to be a memorable blow-out&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>BYTE now returns to its home as a permanent fixture on Friday nights, on a Bi-Monthly basis, we hope you can come join us at one of our future dates</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The legendary Purple Turtle in Camden was infamous for hosting hedonistic Hard House events on Sunday nights back in the day, from the days of hosting Torture Garden&#8217;s sister club Seed (2000-03) to Ultim-8 to BYTE. In full flight &#8220;The Turtle&#8217;s&#8221; vibe of intense, full throttle mayhem could not be replicated in any other venue about London Town...it was a magical and surreal journey through the harder side of House music from the minute you stepped into the venue&#8217; til the &#8216;one more&#8217; was spun...it just had &#8216;THAT&#8217; extra edge that set it apart from its peers! BYTE now returns to its home as a permanent fixture on Friday nights, on a Bi-Monthly basis, we hope you can come join us at one of our future dates. Hard House is back at the Purple Turtle and we look forward to take you on a true musical journey...that&#8217;s it for now...when we see you again we will let the music do the rest of the talking... Keep it Rocking... The BYTE crew&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Come Together concept proved its mettle last summer and are back for their Friday night placement for 12 dates with awesome parties based on the idea of mixing a wide variety of electronic music genres and awesome live performances.
</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Safehouse Management is happy to announce the line up for COME TOGETHER 2011, making it official that Friday nights at Space Ibiza are going to kick the Ibiza club scene into high gear yet again. The COME TOGETHER concept proved its mettle last summer with awesome parties based on the idea of mixing a wide variety of electronic music genres and awesome live performances under one roof at the club DJ Mag readers voted as Number 1 in the world. Safehouse Management says this year&#8217;s party program is going to take the bar even higher. And clubbers from around the world are not the only ones flocking to Space Ibiza on Friday nights. COME TOGETHER has also won the hearts of today&#8217;s biggest electronic music artists including Chase &amp; Status, De La Soul, Faithless Soundsystem, Katy B, Kelis, Magnetic Man, Pendulum, Tinie Tempah and more. Safehouse Management, who organises the event, has also collaborated with Boysnoize Records, Bedrock Records &amp; Viva Music to create the hottest nights featuring the best artists. Only in its second year and COME TOGETHER has firmly established itself as one of the top nights for showcasing the latest trends and megastars of the electronic music scene. And the beauty is: Everyone&#8217;s invited! Line Up Discoteca: Chase &amp; Status (Live), Ms Dynamite (PA) Covered Terrace: Jack Beats, Riva Starr, Daisy Heartbreaker Sunset Terrace: PUKKA UP DJs Red Box: Ugroove.TV pres Lola Ed: Shonky (DC10), Djebali (Freak N Chic) Coming together is not just a name. It&#8217;s a vision. If you pick a name like COME TOGETHER you can&#8217;t afford to leave anybody out of the loop. On the contrary, you have to make sure your party is top of everyone&#8217;s A-list and then you have to open your doors wide enough so they all feel welcome. Safehouse Management has the experience and vision to make that happen. No doubt, they are also fired up by last year&#8217;s success with massive nights and overwhelmingly positive reviews. Whatever the secret, their line-up speaks for itself with live performers including British producers Chase &amp; Status whose explosive sound is guaranteed to blast the PA system; legendary US hip-hop group, De La Soul, well known for seriously rocking the house; Faithless Soundsystem, who will be calling all the faithful back to Space once again for three exclusive gigs; British chart-topping dynamo Katy B, performing with a live band; award winning Kelis, whose new album Flesh Tone is getting top recognition; Magnetic Man, the British dubstep trio of Skream, Benga and Artwork; frenetic Australian megastars Pendulum; and also Tinie Tempah, whose song Pass Out has just been announced as the "Best Contemporary Song" at this year&#8217;s Ivor Novello Awards. Add to that a list of essential DJs with insane amounts of creativity and crowd-pleasing energy and it&#8217;s easy to understand why COME TOGETHER might just become a blueprint for the future of clubbing. It probably doesn&#8217;t hurt that this all takes place on the sunkissed island of Ibiza in a club known for its spectacular sound and light system, indoor/outdoor dance environment and down-to-earth entry prices.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The Horse &amp; Groom is very excited to announce one of the most exciting prospects in modern day electronic music Detroit born Kyle Hall will be playing at the venue on Friday 9th Sept. Kyle has been making serious waves on the scene since the tender age of 18. Born into an outrageously musical family (check the bio, its insane), and brought up and mentored by a plethora of Detroit legends such as Omar S, Rick Wilhite &amp; Theo Parrish; he has taken influence from his surroundings and formed his own individual style - a style that encapsulates the sound of modern day house music. Tickets are strongly advised for this as it will sell out - its not every day you get to see this calibre of artist in the loft of an intimate 400 capacity venue The Shoreditch party venue has had some fantastic acts playing of late including Mr C, Eric Duncan (Rub n Tug) and Dj Nature and watch out lots more in the pipeline including Todd Terje on the 24th Sept tickets on sale now http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?279884&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Having been stunned by the events in London over the last few days The Doctor&#8217;s Orders, headed by Spin Doctor, felt compelled to do something positive and give back to London, their home city, the greatest city in the world. With the help of some of the best Hip-Hop &amp; Soul DJs in town The Doctor&#8217;s Orders have organised this event in order to raise money for those affected by the riots. Money raised to funds set up through local authorities in Hackney, Haringey, Croydon &amp; Lambeth that are helping those that have lost their homes and businesses during the troubles. On top of this money will be donated to youth groups working in Hackney to help reduce the risk of us seeing scenes like this ever again. Your support is greatly appreciated!

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The first UK Stereodays event with Requiem was such a huge success that the only thing to do next was provide another night of class music and great atmosphere, all within a venue with a real WOW factor. So what better way to do this, then to join up with one of the country's leading brands Hi Oktane. Hi Oktane is known for their wicked events up and down the country, hosting rooms at events such as Insomniaczs Magna and Frantic's Hard house Academy. A key factor that contributes massively to the brands success is their ability to get the music spot on at every event they hold which is exactly why Stereodays want to join forces with them... Thats right people, Stereodays vs Hi Oktane is on the cards and what a deck we're holding. Twist and Do Not Bend legend Karim will be back for this event to play a special closing set, at the last event we saw Karim and Ilogik go b2b, which was one of the night's highlights but this time we're going to out do it! 'Ilogik' who is now Stereodays newly signed resident, will be back again this time doing a 2 hour special b2b with the King of Hard house Andy Farley. Adam M &amp; Future Resonance the front men of the two different brands will be up against each other in the VS set of the night, Requiem Star and Mixmag hero Dave Curtis will be providing the crowd with some quality beats for his *Birthday set* and providing the rest of the night with top music are three of Red Artist's up and coming stars, Stereodays' Kevsey D, Hi Octane's Jojo and Ross Homson.

  <short_description>Since the beat met bass people have been hungry for a place to gather and forget the daily grind. You've done the work. You've spent all week stressing, sweating and breaking your back for the big bad machine. Now it's time to down tools and PLAY.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Our party on the 9th of September is delivering the goods yet again, as Egg have scooped headline slots from two award winning D.Js. In room 1 is Milton Jackson, the man credited by DJ magazine as responsible for "reinventing House music for the future" and Room 2 gets incendiary with Rob Mello, a key member of the much loved Classic label family who have been responsible for numerous iconic House releases. There's more. Egg understand that a legendary night isn't just about adrenaline firing line-ups. A maze of deluxe club zones, one of the most distinctive crowds in the capital and an ever-changing array of treats and surprises are in place to keep you playing until everything hurts. Eight spine melting bass lines, six new phone numbers and a broken heel later you'll know why we've got everything right. MILTON JAKSON http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/miltonjackson Milton Jackson got the house music bug aged 18 after receiving an MPC2000 for his birthday. A year later he released his first EP on Stevie Sole's Tronicsole, picked up by Roger Sanchez for a Mixmag compilation. 3 more EPs for Tronicsole followed and an album for Glasgow Underground entitled &#8216;The Bionic Boy' in 2001. Bionic Boy received plaudits from Tom Middleton, Laurent Garnier and Ashley Beadle. Jockey Slut called MJ &#8216;the most exciting thing to happen to UK house music' and awarded the album 5 stars. Bionic Boy spawned some memorable singles; Sunlight even got a review in NME. &#8216;Dimensional' tickled Romanthony's feathers so much he asked to remix it. After the success of Bionic Boy and the accompanying live tour, EPs were completed for the likes of Black Vinyl, Bear Trax (Milton's own label) and Omid 16B's Alola. Milton even worked with a young Mylo on their &#8216;Pretty Boys' project. ROB MELLO http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/robmello London based DJ and Producer; Rob Mello has recorded, produced, and remixed a diverse catalogue of releases since 1992. One of his guises was the pioneering disco and house duo Disco Elements/ Sensory Productions, Previously signed to Azuli Records. Rob was also co-founder of the saucy house label Luxury Service and produced the first Black Science Orchestra single with Ashley Beedle, "Where were you", released on the legendary London house label, Boys Own. Since then Rob has been appearing regularly on Classic Records and after 10 years of releases for this label has produced the very last release on this ground breaking label (Cat nos 000).&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Free Art and Music Festival in Shoreditch/ Dalston</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday Sept 10th will see Haggerston Park, Shoreditch/ Dalston transformed for one day into a free music and art extravaganza showcasing some of London&#8217;s hottest audio and visual talent. Situated 10 mins walk from Shoreditch High St, Haggerston Park sits on the border between Shoreditch and Dalston, 2 of London&#8217;s most creative areas. In the music marquees we have a broad selection of genres including Mel Merio Music star, MTV host, television talking head, fashion model and personality, radio commentator, event producer, Micachu from the widely acclaimed Micachu and the Shapes, Mystro and Logic established names from the UK hiphop scene, Colin Dale Techno pioneer and ex Kiss FM DJ, Mr Shiver who's DJed in pretty much all London's biggest venues the last one being him headlining for Wet Yourself at Fabric in July, Rattus Rattus from the Urban Nerds, Nedry with rave reviews by Radio 1 and the Guardian and much more. In the art area we have live graffiti from Rowan Newton whose visually strong take on street art has caught the attention of many, leading to many exhibitions in New York (Red Dot Art fair, Affordable Art Fair), Miami (Bridge Art Fair), Paris (Affordable Art Fair), Amsterdam (Affordable Art Fair) as well as his home town of London. Also Otto Schade whose distinctive style adorns the 333 club interior and exterior and has also exhibited his work in Concepcion (Chile),Berlin (Germany), Moscow (Russia) , New York (US), Amsterdam (Netherland) and finally to London (UK), where he is currently living and working. In the playground area we have HungaMunga is a creative collective who organise fun parties where you are invited to make stuff, make friends and make a mess. Each party is filled with a plethora arts and crafts materials and hundreds of things to make and do. Also the charity Whizz-Kidz provides disabled children and young people with vital mobility equipment - such as powered wheelchairs - opportunities to meet and have fun, and training to help them gain skills and look forward to a bright future.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>A free day party in Brick Lane</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Apologies to anyone that was left out side at the last party. The venue reached capacity very quickly and the managers/door staff stopped letting people in. We will now be opening a 3rd room if this happens again :-) A slight change has been made to the guest list system. Names will now have to be added each month as the list was getting a bit much for the door staff. Feast is a guest list party, this is to maintain the right atmosphere inside for those who just like to party. Being on the guest list does not guarantee entry, management still reserve the right to refuse entry. Send names to http://feastlondon.net/guestlist Feast will take place on the second saturday of every month from 1pm-1am. Free entry all day. The perfect place to start your weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Cargo is pleased to welcome back Ghost Riders! Jump on board the mystical ghost train for a journey through the deepest underground sounds this side of the dark world. Your captain for the evening will be Luke Solomon. Luke Solomon is undeniably one of British house music's unsung heroes with an impressive track record of underground success. However, besides having chart success throughout the world and running a successful label, Luke really feels like his own career is just beginning. As a solo artist he has had releases on a variety of labels to include the very respected Crosstown Rebels. His first artist album "The Difference Engine" was released in 2008 on the much applauded Rekids label. We look forward to having Luke back under these ancient arches at Cargo. Departure: 10 p.m. Travel time: 5 hours Destination: 3 a.m. Queue Jump guest list: shane@cargo-london.com Doors: 10 p.m. Tickets: Free before 10pm, &#163;10 thereafter&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

We'll be keeping the sounds lush and tidy with the usual progressive techno vibe. Hope you can make it.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Tickets on resident adviser Tickets on clubtickets Join as on Facebook- Logo London DJ info:ROOM 1 Adam Port-Techno&#8217;s biggest flaw is its self-referencial tendency. You know the deal, the common contemporary DJ/Producer steals an Underground Resistance-Record from his older brother at the age of 16, thus presuming to have found the holy grail. His world is shrinking down to Detroit, Chicago, New York and Berlin within the following years, he&#8217;ll equip himself with records and turntables and not look over the rim of his MKII ever again. What Adam Port is laying his hands on might have its place within the parameters of House and Techno, but it&#8217;s always more than that. It&#8217;s his style. B.Voice-At present time Vasily Bvoice is a resident of clubs Arma 17, Shanti. Also he is creating programs on the radiostations RTS (www.rts.fm) and Megapolis FM (local moscow station) Bvoice simply means the voice of man which name starts since "B". More than 10 years of his career Vasily Bvoice became the same sign of the russian clublife as blue light of Mix-Club or the sequrity in Propaganda club. He appears in the best dancefloors across all USSR (RIP) and the last time across the world - from Thailand till Columbia. Terje Bakke-&#8221;Terje Bakke has been in the electronic dance music scene since 2004.He have released music in different genres of the scene. Recently he signed for labels such as Be Chosen and Soulfooled to reach another level. Hailing from cultural Bergen, Norway he have got the chance to form his own characteristic style which could be described as soulful repetitive rhythms with a touch of modern melodies. Tomasz Wakulewski-Tomasz's love of electronic music began in 1993. Born and raised in a small city in Poland - Bielsk Podlaski, he was exposed to the House Music movement at 17. His style then was a mixture of House and Detroit Techno. On moving to London in 2003 his Dj sets began to take shape. Now Tomasz Wakulewski is part of generation of Producers who are blurring the boudaries between Techno and Electronica performing in London's Shoreditch bars and clubs. ROOM 2 CLUBB ROCK are DJ and production team Mikee Lazy and Darren Judge. Known for rocking parties and dancefloors all over the UK and Europe individually for the last 15 years, their turntablist inspired DJ sets and years of experience sees them bouncing off each other playing their brand of big beats, dirty basslines, exclusive mash-ups .They have supported acts such as De La Soul, DJ Yoda, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Cash Money, and DJ Craze. Krzysztof Kozber ,aka sirius, dj and producer originates from Bydgoszcz (Poland), but is now living in London.He joined up with other Minimal Techno dj's Temba, a collective of djs.Immediatly after that, in 2006, he joined Brickbeat. Sirius also produces his own music ,taking inspiration from Minimal Tech, Hip Hop, BreakBeat and Jazz. see you all on the dance floor!&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

His current activities include 2 new EP's on Loco Records/Beef Records, a fabulously deep remix of Tony Lioni's "Precious" on Freerange Records, a production partnership with Freerange stalwart Pezzner (under the "Arithmetics" moniker) - check their latest Bubba remix on Alive records&#8230;.he&#8217;s also busy creating the new Mididropmusic EP in the lab....suffice to say he's been a very busy boy of late. Norm De Plume, host of the Delusions Of Grandeur podcast is a DJ you may be less familiar with, but his debut release on Plumage last November earned plays from DJ Harri, The Revenge, Tornado Wallace, Scope and Herb LF. His remix of Tornado Wallace's "Alway's Twirling" on DoG received support from Steve Bug and Ralph Lawson and his latest release: &#8220;The Groove Grocer EP&#8221; is expected any day now on the excellent (vinyl only) Detroit based, Kolour Limited label. Expect Norm to keep it Deep &#8216;n&#8217; Low with an arsenal of slo-mo deep, chunky edits, offering up plenty of original disco &amp; boogie 12"s &amp; edits along the way. This will eventually make way for deep mid-tempo house vibes through to pacier, more electronic underground house from both DJs&#8230;..and of course some up-front , pre-release Freerange &amp; DOG nuggets! upstairs-Deepdown -Deep Down is finally here with there launch party in the one and only London town of Shoreditch. We are ready to take you to a place where we all know you love being especially with some DEEP &amp; Disco vibes. The venue-The Horse &amp; Groom or "The Disco Pub" as she is fondly know in clubland circles is located on curtain road with a traditional yet quirky interior, fully stocked bars over 2 spacious floors with plenty of room to drink&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>3 DJs, 2 Rooms, One Night
The Liberators are celebrating 20 years on the underground dance music scene and will take over both Jamm rooms with no other DJs in the line up and tear a big fat hole in the Jamm Funktion 1 sound system. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Now there are certain things worth celebrating and when you hear a group of guys who have been massively instrumental to the development of a particular part of the dance music scene have been are about to celebrate 20 years since their fast squat party in North London, it is a party you want to be involved in. Calling All Types&#8230;&#8230;..let&#8217;s Av It! On this, their historic 20 year anniversary, Liberator, the stalwarts of London Techno re-unite for a night of revelry, friendship and weirdness, with a party harking back to their old school roots, a rave with a difference, featuring just 3 DJ's playing thundering techno and acid techno from the past to the present in room 1, with an old school selection of rave, electro, hip hop and house in room 2, in a venue extra pumped up with decor from some of the scenes leading lights. Come and 'ave it with Liberator, still tuned in and dedicated to the pulse of the dispossessed. Chris, Aaron and Julian Liberator are true legends of techno having DJ&#8217;d all over the world and who kick started what was to become acid techno via their seminal record label Stay Up Forever. Coming straight out of the free party rave movement that brought you Spiral Tribe and the last great free festival Castle Morton, now 20 years on they still represent the rave ideal that you have the right to party no matter what the powers that be say. In September 1991 they made their first all night techno party in a Squat in North London. In September 2011 for one night only they will be playing in both rooms with no supporting acts. Line Up Chris, Aaron and Julian Liberator 3 DJs, 2 Rooms, One Night&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Recklessly collide unique creative characters with high caliber musical talent and you directly challenge the established boundaries of clubbing. Big line-ups don&#8217;t have to mean a faceless, generic club experience and glamorous events can have incredible soundtracks. This is the philosophy at the heart of Heroes, the latest multi sensory adventure in Partyland to hatch from maverick club destination Egg. Dance music in all forms takes centre stage across 3 floors as internationally renowned DJs go AWOL from prestigious residencies for one incredible night. Alongside the big time talent a savvy selection of up and comers get the crowd hot and a menagerie of performers, hosts, dancers and delightful surprises keep them that way. Heroes. You tear them from the magazine to pin to your wall basking in their hyperreal, super groomed brightness. You twitch in sweat soaked anticipation of their latest Tweet. Now join us Saturday 13th 2011 to celebrate the icons of culture that you already love and press flesh with the heroes that are yet to be.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>FILTH - The New Beginning // Sat 10th Spetember @ The Warehouse, Leeds.  Feat. Butch, Martinez, Uner, NTFO &amp; more...</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;FILTH - The New Beginning Sat 10th Spetember @ The Warehouse, Leeds Main Room: Butch (Cecille / Get Physical) Martinez (Cadenza / Moon Harbour) Uner (Diynamic / 2020Vision) NTFO (Diynamic / Pura Music) Luke Pompey Room 2 (Push:On) King Tut &amp; The Wookie Danny Matthews Michael Russell Dean Gatenby Luke Gibson Lee M Kelsall The Warehouse is undergoing refurbishment as we speak. The official relaunch is 10th Septemeber, prepare to be amazed! After years of packed-out parties at the illustrious Mint Club, Filth have made the bold decision to take their party somewhere new, but just as illustrious&#8230; namely the history soaked, legendary rave space that is The Warehouse. The club has been taken over with a view to returning it to its former glories (everyone from Frankie Goes to Hollywood to Sugar Hill Gang to Sasha has played here, whilst legendary nights like Speed Queen and Kaos will live long in the memory) so of course a Funktion One has been installed as well as all new lighting rigs. Elsewhere the infrastructure has been upgraded with new chill out areas featuring leather lounge beds, a new, state of the art DJ booth, new plumbing, new toilets, and new air conditioning. Filth itself has undergone some summer changes, too, with a new focus on the underground and all its myriad strains of house and tech. Opening up this new era and new collaboration will be a fine selection of DJs and producers with their finger&#8217;s firmly on the electronic pulse&#8230; Firstly comes German Turk Butch &#8211; the owner of his own Bouq label and a producer and DJ with huge house hits like &#8216;No Worries&#8217; on Cecille and gigs everywhere from Fabric to all in his locker. Cocoon, 8Bit and 100%Pure have also released the man&#8217;s record which range from sample heavy anthems to more delicate and musical creations that delve deeper than your average banger. Martinez meanwhile is a dancefloor specialist &#8211; his hard hitting tech house and huge drops propel crowds as long as he is in the booth. Often playing his own steely cuts, he also release on Moon Harbour and Cadenza and is one of the most dexterous DJs we know&#8230; The next two headliners both come from Hamburg&#8217;s instrument rich tech house stable Diynamic. Both Uner and new stars NTFO have the sort of unhinged house take on things which make them perfect for Solomun&#8217;s widely respected and genre leading label. As ever, this new Filth will be built upon the solid credentials of its residents &#8211; all of Luke Pompey, Danny Savage (also promoter), King Tut &amp; The Wookie have a wealth of experience both locally and internationally &#8211; spinning scorching house sets which perfectly set the tone for the headliners at every event, whilst the second room at The Warehouse will be hosted by Leeds underground party, PUSH:ON. Sure to be the first page of a new chapter, this partnership between Filth&#8217;s ever evolving music policy, their uninhibited party disciples and The Warehouse&#8217;s undeniable club credentials make for one of the most exciting prospects of the new term in Leeds&#8230; make sure you&#8217;re there.

  <short_description>Ted Bhunson presents: Extrawelt (Live) and Max Cooper at Lightbox</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Flying in from Hamburg their first live show since Matter 2009 , we have the audio delights of Arne Schaffhausen and Wayan Raabe in the guise of Extrawelt. Prolific with Cocoon and Traum globally, Extrawelt have the leading edge in Tech House. But if anyone was capable of playing alongside them then it could be only Max Cooper. Currently playing out to audiences worldwide, Max has stepped up to the plate and is as consistently good entertainer as any out there. With his own unique quirky style set to make your mind bend. This is an event for people who love the style. Lightbox is in our humble opinion the most personal and fun club in London right now. Boasting a unique light system and intimate rooms. www.thelightboxlondon.co.uk. Its doors are not darkened enough and each time they are, people will always remember it as one of the personal experiences in London. This is promising to be one of the most unique parties of the year inside of London with an amazing vibe rivalled only by that of the smaller clubs of Berlin. It will be a night that will leave you wondering, why are there not more parties with these guys and in this kind of space! We await your part in this trip. Entry will be limited! First come. First served.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>After the short summer brake Cartuli's Day is back with an exclusive line up &amp; artists.
Performing on the night 2Live sets by guests Glimpse and Tom Demac + Cartuli's residents Unai Trotti &amp; Alex Cliche', Enrique Amerigo &amp; Nathalia.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Cartuli's!! after the summer break, we'll back the next 10 of September with another amazing and great . This time with 2 live sets very specials: Glimpse Live (Crosstown Rebels, Planet E, Cocoon) Prolific and fearless, tireless and imaginative &#8211; taking only his work in the past twelve months into account, Glimpse demonstrated a quality of work and range which only a few can be said to have matched. World renowned labels such as Crosstown Rebels, Planet E, Cadenza, Cocoon, Get Physical and Buzzin Fly are just a handful of those to have released his music. He will make a very especial and exclusive live for Cartuli's of 1 hour and a half. Bringing his Roland 909 for be part of his show Tom Demac (Mumur, Liebe*Detail, Hypercolour) The Mancunian house DJ/producer's sound is all about groove. His trademark deep bass lines and spacious vocals give his music an irresistible atmosphere which we can't wait to witness first hand this July. It's now just over a a year since Tom gave up his day job and took up the music full-time. Just over 12 months ago he removed his cape, stepped out of the charming and convincing Web Design manager alter-ego, and has spent every week day since hunched over his synths in the studio. So far, his 2 stand-out tracks, 'Rivalry with Irony' and 'Slip Slop Slap' have been hitting monthly top 10 and top 30 respectively on Resident Advisor. Combined with a healthy year of gigging, including taking his Live show to Fabric, Space - Ibiza, Mulletover, Freerotation and many other places in between (collecting a fine selection of club toilet photos along the way), being remixed by Soulphiction, Luke Solomon, Jamie Jones, Wolf and Lamb, Dave Aju etc&#8230;2011 is already shaping up to be a good year for Tom with more releases lined up for Murmur, Liebe Detail, Hypercolour and the launch of the new techno project - 'Dense' with good friend Glimpse. For complete the line up we will have our residents: Unai Trotti (Cartuli's, Release Sustain, Cray1, Jaded) Alex Cliche' (Cartuli's, Jaded) Enrique Amerigo (Cartuli's) and the great talent and a usual in the London night in charge for the warm-up this night. Nathalia (Relations/Leading Astray) ------- Tickets Advance RA 8&#163; Concession 10&#163; Entrance 12&#163; -------- Cartuli's Dat Warehouse (Jacks) 7-9 Crucifix Lane Se1 3jw London Bridge Doors open at 23:00 on the 10 of September and close very late. 1 room with latest tendencies of music house / techno / minimal / techouse Nearest tube London Bridge " Bus: London Bridge Station (17,21,35,40,43,47,48,133,?141,149,343,381,521, N21, N35, N47, N133, N343, N381) Guestlist: cartulis.guestlist@gmail.com See you on the dance-floor!

  <short_description>ExiT launches its very first tour to Ibiza as we go up against the legendary Pukka Up on a 3 day voyage stopping off at Kanya, Space, Plastik, Itaca, and the infamous Sunset Boat Party</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;ExiT launches its very first tour to Ibiza as we go up against the legendary Pukka Up on a 3 day voyage stopping off at Kanya, Space, Plastik, Itaca, and the infamous and renowned Sunset Boat Party Following our sell out UK events, ExiT has decided to fly out to Ibiza to join industry friends Pukka Up for a 3 day mini tour. Kicking off on Monday 12 September, ExiT will be hosting a Pool Party at the simply beautiful and beach resort Kanya. Tuesday the 13th features ExiT's biggest and boldest event to date, as we launch our very first salt water boat party, taking in the world famous Ibiza sunset. Heading off the boat we move over to Plastik for a warm-up party, there will be brief rest bite, before we join Pukka Up once again as we play host to El Salon at Space for Come Together with Carl Cox. Also featuring Green Velvet &amp; Nic Fanculli Finally as we bid farewell to the warmth of Ibiza we will be throwing one last party at another waterfront venue Itaca. Packing all this into 3 days is going to ensure we have one non stop party from the moment the plane lands until we depart. And we intend to give it every ounce of energy we have. ExiT' very own godfathers Daisy Diggler and G.O.D will be providing the soundtrack joined by some very special DJ friends from Pukka Up. If you are in Ibiza between the 12-14th, and fancy getting involved we have discount tickets priced at a mere &#163;50, which gets you access to all our events - Pool Party, Sunset Boat Party, Pre party, Free Bus to Space, Entry to Space, ExiT closing party at Itaca.

  <short_description>Following their sold out gig at Brixton&#8217;s O2 Academy, US band Beirut take the short walk down the road to Jamm, where they will host their official aftershow party with exclusive Beirut DJ set and Molotov Jukebox Live.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The night will provide all the chance to see members of Beirut behind the decks as they offer an exclusive DJ set to finish off their night in the capital in style. With this bands unique energy and understanding of how to really rock a crowd, this will be a DJ set that we have no doubt will go down in Jamm history as the band and their fans party through until dawn. In addition, Molotov Jukebox, one of the hottest bands currently pushing their way to the top of the UK scene, will be performing live. With the incredibly talented actress of Harry Potter and About a Boy fame, singer and accordionist Natalia Tena at the forefront of five excellent musicians, they have the presence and performance that is gaining critical acclaim and fan base alike. Beirut have released two critically acclaimed albums with a third, &#8220;The Rip Tide&#8221; to be released approximately two weeks prior to the forthcoming London gig. The bands fusion of eastern European folk, indie, electronica and pop has gained Beirut an enormous international following. Having sold out their Academy gig more than two months in advance of the performance date, the opportunity to witness this band up close and personal in a somewhat intimate venue is an event not to be missed. Six piece band Molotov Jukebox will perform live, showcasing their infectious &#8220;Gyp-Step&#8221; sound that blends diverse influences from gypsy to funk and dubstep to punk. As well as the for mentioned films, lead singer Natalia Tena will be starring in new film releases this year &#8220;You Instead&#8221; and &#8220;Bel Ami&#8221; (alongside Robert Pattison and Uma Thurman) plus her fantastic role as Osha in HBO series Game Of Thrones is set to be reprised next year. So it comes as little surprise, one of the groups strongest attributes is their live performance. With some of the capitals best venues and UKs favourite festivals on the bands CV, which include Cargo, Scala and Ronnie Scott&#8217;s, plus Glastonbury, Big Chill, Lovebox, T In The Park and Secret Garden Party, they have developed an infectious and encapsulating live set that will shake the foundations of Jamm on the 16th September. There is no doubt that if you were not lucky enough to purchase your ticket for the live show, this will go some way to ease the pain especially featuring DJ set from the band themselves and the live headline from Molotov Jukebox. Another amazing Academy afterparty at Jamm. Beirut After Party: Beirut DJ Set Molotov Jukebox Live More TBC Jamm Live Presents from 9pm: Polaris Condition Mavis more TBC&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>South London&#8217;s own Skoda Beats Collective diligently bring you the highest quality soirees around and now create their pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance: Balkan Sonic</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Some describe the striking, upbeat sound as 'music of the last great depression brought up to date for the current one'' and it&#8217;s taking over London's dancefloors. Think of the illicit fun of the Jazz Age, mix in Eastern European, Swing and Arabic flavour and then add the cutting edge sounds of modern electronic percussion. Balkan Sonik fuses influences such as Hip Hop, Dubstep, House, Drum &amp; Bass, and Twisted Electronica. Here you will find computer versus accordion, sampler versus trumpet and drumbox versus derbouka. This party is one that is in full swing! It&#8217;s not so much an aural assault but more a natural rhythm with extremely danceable tunes and blaring brassy energy - get ready to sweat! For this event we will celebrate the end of the summer. All the Balkan Sonik Djs will meet once again after a busy festival season indeed. Gino did an amazing performance at the "Hadra festival" representing Balkan Sonik for the first time in France.( people are still talking about it over there...) Fred Balkayou played on the side of the "Balkan Beat Box" for their only London, and also had a great time playing at the "Arcade festival in Oxfordshire". And Wattknot excelled at the "Secret Garden Party". The story goes on ...&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Come Together concept proved its mettle last summer and are back for their Friday night placement for 12 dates with awesome parties based on the idea of mixing a wide variety of electronic music genres and awesome live performances.
</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Safehouse Management is happy to announce the line up for COME TOGETHER 2011, making it official that Friday nights at Space Ibiza are going to kick the Ibiza club scene into high gear yet again. The COME TOGETHER concept proved its mettle last summer with awesome parties based on the idea of mixing a wide variety of electronic music genres and awesome live performances under one roof at the club DJ Mag readers voted as Number 1 in the world. Safehouse Management says this year&#8217;s party program is going to take the bar even higher. And clubbers from around the world are not the only ones flocking to Space Ibiza on Friday nights. COME TOGETHER has also won the hearts of today&#8217;s biggest electronic music artists including Chase &amp; Status, De La Soul, Faithless Soundsystem, Katy B, Kelis, Magnetic Man, Pendulum, Tinie Tempah and more. Safehouse Management, who organises the event, has also collaborated with Boysnoize Records, Bedrock Records &amp; Viva Music to create the hottest nights featuring the best artists. Only in its second year and COME TOGETHER has firmly established itself as one of the top nights for showcasing the latest trends and megastars of the electronic music scene. And the beauty is: Everyone&#8217;s invited! Line Up Discoteca: Magnetic Man (Live), Pendulum (EL Hornet DJ Set) &amp; MC Verse, Jaguar Skills Covered Terrace: Brodinski Sunset Terrace: PUKKA UP DJs Red Box: Hosted By Future Disco: Ian Blevins, Dom Chung Coming together is not just a name. It&#8217;s a vision. If you pick a name like COME TOGETHER you can&#8217;t afford to leave anybody out of the loop. On the contrary, you have to make sure your party is top of everyone&#8217;s A-list and then you have to open your doors wide enough so they all feel welcome. Safehouse Management has the experience and vision to make that happen. No doubt, they are also fired up by last year&#8217;s success with massive nights and overwhelmingly positive reviews. Whatever the secret, their line-up speaks for itself with live performers including British producers Chase &amp; Status whose explosive sound is guaranteed to blast the PA system; legendary US hip-hop group, De La Soul, well known for seriously rocking the house; Faithless Soundsystem, who will be calling all the faithful back to Space once again for three exclusive gigs; British chart-topping dynamo Katy B, performing with a live band; award winning Kelis, whose new album Flesh Tone is getting top recognition; Magnetic Man, the British dubstep trio of Skream, Benga and Artwork; frenetic Australian megastars Pendulum; and also Tinie Tempah, whose song Pass Out has just been announced as the "Best Contemporary Song" at this year&#8217;s Ivor Novello Awards. Add to that a list of essential DJs with insane amounts of creativity and crowd-pleasing energy and it&#8217;s easy to understand why COME TOGETHER might just become a blueprint for the future of clubbing. It probably doesn&#8217;t hurt that this all takes place on the sunkissed island of Ibiza in a club known for its spectacular sound and light system, indoor/outdoor dance environment and down-to-earth entry prices.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Cut &amp; Shut Disco once again darken the doors of the H&amp;G for another unabashed, hands in the air party</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;As always, expect grooves from diva disco to left-field house bangers and rock oddities, all underpinned by an unrelenting groove. Carrying on in the tradition of steering away from the obvious choice guests, this time they are flying in the Austrian 'disco child', Mike Burns (Phoenix Project / Disco Devil / Kojak Giant Sounds / Vienna, Austria) to aid them in bringing the heat. Anyone who has set foot in a record shop in the last few years will know this name is synonymous with quality dance music, and we can attest to his skills as one of Austrias finest DJs... MIKE BURNS (Phoenix Project / Disco Devil / Kojak Giant Sounds / Vienna, Austria) Mike Burns loves him some music. Music that draws you in, takes you for a ride and brings you back home. Music dripping with funk and radiating euphoria. Music out of the ordinary and music that simply puts a smile on your face. As a DJ, notoriously enthusiastic about playing records, it's this energy he tries to share on dance floors willing to engage. The Austrian DJ &amp; producer has been active since the late 90s and has thus burnt down quite a handful of dance floors across Vienna. He ran the legendary but now sadly defunkt Bongo Club night and still hosts the monthly Blankton web radio show, now in its 6th year. His brand of hypnotic leftfield disco edits for labels like Disco Devil, Kojak Giant Sounds and his own Phoenix Project imprint, have received heavy praise and have made their way into his own and the DJ sets of several others around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s profane. Arousing. Infuriating. Intriguing. Uncomfortable. Obscene. It&#8217;s assaulting the dancefloor, evolving in the laboratory, scrawled across the sketchbook and illuminating every screen. It&#8217;s indefinable, unobtainable, frightening and bizarre - but you can&#8217;t stop staring straight at it. It&#8217;s The Future Now. Egg London is undergoing a dramatic transformation as part of the massive King's Cross Development. The Future Now is the flagship event of this new era, taking over once a month to unite all the clubs boutique spaces and create a labyrinthine forum for some of the most exciting international talent. The Future Now lures the next generation of original thinkers away from their cramped studios, matchbox venues and backroom happenings to be part of an ambitious clubbing experiment. The Future Now is instant access to the forward thinking partymakers and creatives who will directly influence the music, parties and styles that will be mimicked for years to come. Launching 16th September 2011 to coincide with London Fashion Week, and in association with Wearable Art, Egg&#8217;s bi-annual fashion focused event, the debut party is a celebration of the most innovative and inspirational developments in personal style. Signposting the way forward but continuously mindful of the heritage that informs the zeitgeist TFN is the perfect collision of the familiar and the alien. The explosive energy of the new is anchored by a respectful nod to the established names in art, fashion and music that precipitated the bold advancements that have come to define our contemporary culture.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>The Gallery Pres. MOS 20th Birthday, Friday 16th Sep. 22.30pm - 7am.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Box: Eddie Halliwell Sean Tyas Sied van Riel Jochen Miller 103 &#8211; Retrospective House 20 Years: Danny Rampling X Press 2 Gavyn Mytchel &amp; Steve Lee Baby Box &#8211; Deliverance Loft &#8211; Plastic Fondu A milestone which few clubs ever reach, be upstanding for Ministry Of Sound &#8211; the 20th anniversary. Kicking off the weekend festivities, with a line-up fit for the King of clubs. The Gallery presents the past, present and future as part of the TWENTY weekend. The 103 takes a retrospective look at the best in house. So who better than its founding father, DANNY RAMPLING. Responsible for bringing those Balearic beats to Blighty, the former Radio 1 resident will ensure the party gets started. Pioneers of the underground scene, deck wizards X-PRESS 2 spread their sound worldwide - with tracks such as Smoke Machine and Lazy. Though if feeling the latter from all that dancing, forget it! Gallery residents GAVYN MYTCHEL and STEVE LEE go B2B. Their combination of anthemic offerings, always guarantees dancefloor debauchery. Next door, a main room melange of trance heroes. Never mind the past twenty years, EDDIE HALLIWELL was nominated Mixmag&#8217;s greatest DJ of ALL TIME! His CDJ trickery well known, Halliwell&#8217;s here to stay with debut single Neon &#8211; and new label FIUR widely acclaimed. SEAN TYAS produced arguably the greatest Gallery anthem, &#8216;Lift.&#8217; His tough tearing sets now a Ministry mainstay, we&#8217;ll just let Tyas do the talking. Finally two artists to spearhead The Gallery&#8217;s future SE1 stint. Handpicked by Mr Corsten to play his Ibiza &#8216;Full On Ferry&#8217; night, SIED VAN RIEL keeps it real with an inimitable production style. Finally Armin Van Buuren&#8217;s top tip sees out the finale. That&#8217;s JOCHEN MILLER, after April&#8217;s sell-out Brixton Academy show. The Gallery and Ministry Of Sound. Here&#8217;s to another twenty years&#8230; -- 10.30pm &#8211; Close Ministry of Sound 103 Gaunt Street, London, SE1 6DP Tube: Elephant &amp; Castle Contact: 020 3142 6756 gavyn@thegallery-club.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Liminal Sounds returns to the Rhythm Factory for a night of dubstep, garage and house with the Get Some Crew. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;We are very proud to announce that the one and only Trim will be headlining in Room One with DJ Begg. Ten mixtapes deep, he shows no signing of slowing down any time soon, remaining one of the most prolific, consistent and unique MCs of our generation. His inimitable flow, deft wordplay and dry humour are always on point and with an album in the works he is on the top of his game. Unafraid to experiment, recent collaborations with the likes of Becoming Real, Mark Pritchard and Starkey have birthed great results. Damu was the first artist to contribute to the burgeoning Liminal Sounds mix series, and has continued to impress us ever since. He has quickly made an indelible mark on the scene with his hyperkinetic, luminous productions, winning praise from the likes of Fact and XLR8R. Having already dropped releases on Local Action and Silverback, he has further releases set for Blackdown&#8217;s revered Keysound imprint and Swing &amp; Skip. He has also been working on some material with Trim, so keep your ear to the ground for that to surface. MIK is another MC who is consistently exciting and always does his own thing. The Family Tree affiliated MC has been in the game for a while and having honed his sound to a tee he is in charge of one of sharpest flows in grime. He has worked with an impressive array of producers that includes Kahn, Faze Miyake and Spooky to name a few. Watch out for more new material from him soon. Visionist&#8217;s fresh brand of deadly 808 bass music has quickly caught the ear of many, and one listen to his releases on 92 Points and the Tokyo-based Diskotopia imprint will be all the explanation you need. With further released scheduled on Throwing Snow&#8217;s Left_Blank label and Oneman&#8217;s burgeoning 502 imprint, his stock is undoubtedly going to continue rising. Poland-born, London-dwelling Venice Calypso makes club music at its most potent. Powerful, energetic and just brash enough to ensure it grabs your attention, his music wriggles through the speakers with enough impact and groove to distract you from the inherent oddity of its combating sonics, idiosyncratic melodies and skittering, overloaded rhythms in a way reminiscent of the halcyon days of instrumental grime. His heavy tribal drum patterns and wired synth hooks immediately stand out with his inimitable sonic stamp. We are also extremely pleased to be presenting the night in collaboration with Get Some, the crew behind the brilliant blog of the same name who are preparing to unleash the debut release on their newly minted label as we speak. Since the blog&#8217;s inception in Autumn 2009, they have endeavoured to showcase the best UK underground talent, pushing good music irrespective of genre, and will be bringing this open-minded and forward-thinking attitude to the label. Get Some will be hosting Room 2 with a special lineup of friends and affiliates that we are extremely excited about. The Get Some DJs will be joined by 2nd Drop records, the label responsible for a series of brilliant releases from the likes of Ramadanman, Clouds, Sully, Duncan Powell and LV. On the lineup will also be Brighton-based producer Eagles For Hands, who is behind the inaugural release on the label with his eponymous EP of nuanced and textured bass mutations and Crypt, a producer whose star is most definitely in the ascendant and has recently joined the Get Some stable.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Every Saturday night we'll ensure an electrifyingly unique evening, surrounded by the most colourful and fabulous crowd constantly pushing the party experience in new exciting and daring directions.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Dress to impress, we're the most glamorous night out in Shoreditch. Red hot on the lips of the filthy rich and the insanely sexy, The Hoxton Pony the quintessential example of a truly unique and ultra flamboyant party experience in East London. Frequented by the fiendishly attractive and the self confident; the epitome of cool and the crucible for a crazy, uninhibited dress-up; The Hoxton Pony offers you the opportunity to mix fashion, hedonism and exhibitionism. Every Saturday night we'll ensure an electrifyingly unique evening, surrounded by the most colourful and fabulous crowd constantly pushing the party experience in new exciting and daring directions. From the casino rooftops of Vegas to the New Year&#8217;s crowds of the Australian Festivals we welcome The Loose Cannons. The Cannons have come a long, long way from their humble beginnings in a bedsit in South London, to being amongst the UK&#8217;s most critically, media and industry acclaimed Artists, DJ/Producers and Radio Broadcasters. The Don-Daddas of DJ Duo-dom, Kaiser Saucy &amp; Lord Fader have rocked the party across the world, from the E4 Skins house-party in London, to the Australian Music Awards in Sydney, aboard Armani&#8217;s yacht in Monte Carlo, to student parties in NYC, narrowly avoiding arrest in Dubai, via an uber-art exhibition in Singapore, Manumission in Ibiza, and Exit in Serbia. And even Keith-Prodigy&#8217;s wedding as well as hitting all the main UK festivals, including Glastonbury, V, Lovebox and Glade. Radio1&#8217;s Rob Da Bank described the LCs as &#8220;undoubtedly the finest party djs this side of Mars and our Bestival after party DJs of choice.&#8221; It will be nothing short of mental. Assured.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Lasermagnetic&#8217;s monthly party at the Horse &amp; Groom ontinues&#8230;For our September edition, we welcome 2 international DJ/producers John Morales from NYC  one of the early pioneers of Dance Mixing/Remixing DJ  and  Berlin-Munich-Disco-Machine DJ Kaos,</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;DJ John Morales-John Morales was born in the Bronx, New York and has been involved in the creation of hit records for the better part of 30 years, playing at spots like Pippins, Bentleys, Limelight and the infamous Studio 54. Like many DJs of the 70s, John ventured into the studio more through need than necessity, making medleys and remixes because the records in those days were too short and being a DJ, he needed to get more out of the records he was spinning. His now infamous &#8216;Deadly Medleys&#8217; and &#8216;Sunshine Acetate Medleys&#8217; brought him to attention of New York disco producers Greg Carmichael and Patrick Adams who were impressed by the hunger and desire of the self-taught engineer. A meeting at New York&#8217;s influential WBLS radio station, where Cuban-born Sergio Munzibai worked as musical director alongside Frankie Crocker (and later at Motown Records), would signal the next chapter in Morales&#8217; career resulting in the most prolific remix partnership in the 1980s and 90s. M&amp;M productions have over 650 mixes to their name, with ground-breaking records for the likes of Class Action, Jocelyn Brown, Shakatak, Miami Sound Machine, The Temptations, Tina Turner, The Rolling Stones, Spandau Ballet, Aretha Franklin, Shalamar, Hall &amp; Oates, Candi Station, Billy Ocean, The Commodores and even Peter Schilling and Rod Stewart. In fact, just about every major artist of the day was in some way retouched by the hands of Morales &amp; Munzibai. He&#8217;s recently completed mixing recordings for CD compilation releases under M&amp;M for BBE, that contain new expanded editions of James Brown and the Four Tops, Marvin Ashford &amp; Simpson and many more. Dj Kaos is an integral part of the Berlin underground scene, producing a variety of twisted dance music for a number of years now. His first single was a collaboration with Ash Ra Temple&#8217;s Manuel Goettsching (of E2-E4 fame.) He's performed all over the Globe, from Europe, Japan, Australia to the US. He has released original music on such seminal dance labels as Eskimo, Clone, For Discos Only, as well as early singles for Rong Music and now Rong/ DFA. His remixes have proven in demand, remixing everyone from Chk Chk Chk to Roxy Music to the New Young Pony Club. Kaos is a part of the exclusive K7 Records DJ Kicks mix series with his eclectic mix released in 1995, as well as his full-length solo LP released on K7 in 2005. He also participated in the Faith Records "Collectors Series" with a mix CD entitled "Danse, Gravite Zero" created with Sal Principiato of the legendary NYC group Liquid Liquid. DJ Kaos With his smash hit "Love the Nite Away" [Rong/DFA] made its way to the Top Tracks of Pitchfork USA, Resident Advisor and Top Singles on DFA. As he never rests the next extraterrestrial 12" is on it's way! Kosmischer R&#252;ckenwind/ Rough Side on Clone Loft Supreme Series. Mr Kaos with a debut on Clone records. Main title is Kosmicher Ruckenwind which is a magnificent piece of almost psychedelic kraut rock inspired disco house with trippy guitars and spaced out sounds. Its sounds almost like Manuel G&#246;ttsching and Pink Floyd were jamming with Kaos. 12 minutes, and not 1 minute to long. DJ Kaos' "Horny Morning Loop" with outstanding remixes by TVS &amp; Aera and Dr.Dunks will be Vinyl, digitally released on Monday, October 18th on his new imprint Jolly Jams http://www.facebook.com/JOLLYJAMS&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Spectrum: Leeds - Drumsound &amp; Bassline Smith - Sat 17th Sept // The Warehouse, Leeds</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Spectrum: Leeds Launch The Warehouse, Leeds Saturday September 17th, 2011 Drumsound &amp; Bassline Smith Bare Noize Heavy Feet Pete Jordan The Warehouse: 19-21 Somers Street, Leeds, LS1 2RG (0113) 246 8118 We are pleased to make the first in a series of big Autumn announcements for Spectrum. The London-based award winning club brand started the year celebrating its 10th Birthday in front of thousands at Ewer Street Warehouse. On making his European debut at the event, Skrillex proclaimed the night to be &#8220;seriously life changing&#8221; and despite having its roots in the Midlands (Nottingham and Birmingham), Spectrum has become one of the most talked about club events in the capital. For the first time it brings its uniquely programmed shows to Leeds at the famous Warehouse venue, recently refurbed and due to open on August bank holiday . Starting monthly on Saturday September 17th, the first event is headlined by the on-form Drumsound &amp; Bassline Smith. Stalwarts of the UK drum and bass scene, their latest track Close is currently enjoying Radio 1 playlist action and is set to enter the UK Charts when released on August 22nd. https://www.facebook.com/drumsoundandbasslinesmith Dubstep phenomenon Bare Noize, bring their brand of bass to The Warehouse for the first time. Having remixed the likes of Tinie Tempah, Lady Gaga and Skrillex in the last 12 months, it is little surprise that the duo have become hot property all over the world, and a firm favourite with Spectrum. https://www.facebook.com/barenoize ` Manchester based HeavyFeet have moved their sound on from the electro styles they were making around 2008. Recent EP's on Plant Music and the 12 releases in 12 months on their Stamp Beats label have proven just how diverse and talented they are both in the studio and behind the decks. https://www.facebook.com/heavyfeet The last of the four headliner's is the on-form Pete Jordan. It's been a busy year in the studio for the Spectrum man, with numerous solo and collaborative releases on labels such as Top Billn, Gung-Ho!, Westway etc. His new single Step Out featuring Texan Rapper, Joe B as received universal praise across the popular music press. Pete's DJ sets are well known for his unique cross genre-selection and technical ability. https://www.facebook.com/petejordanpage Further announcements to be made soon on the rest of the line up, but it's fair to say we look forward to launching at The Warehouse in Leeds, a club and a city with a rich electronic music and party heritage.

  <short_description>Red Molecule presents  - Twisted Frequency with Fergie at Lightbox</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;James Harcourt's Twisted Frequency label teams up with London's Motek and Indian collective Red Molecule / Digitorq for a Saturday night extravaganza at one of London's hottest spots - the Lightbox - right next to Vauxhall tube station in South Lambeth Place. Topping the bill on the night is Northern Ireland's Fergie - a DJ of true international standing - and someone who has never had a stronger and more vibrant aural identity. Playing the kind of music he wants, determined not to be held back by perceptions and tags from the past, he continues to be a global representative for electronic music by consistently breaking down underground barriers and bringing new music to the people, without compromise. There is no doubt that Fergie has firmly re-established himself as a producer of innovative exciting music that really takes a hold of you. Having dedicated himself to the studio for the past few years, where he totally immersed himself in his passion for music, this has been a true labour of love. Supporting is James Harcourt, who has been taking his sound around the world alongside first love of music production. Known mostly for his underground yet wide selling tracks such as Call &amp; Response, Dankesch&#246;n and Arachnofunk - James has had recent releases on Dave Seaman's Audio Therapy, legendary Trance label Bonzai as well as Popof's Form imprint. From India, Dual Drive are an act who favour harder no-nonsense techno and who are building up a reputation at the start of what promises to be a fruitful career of DJ'ing and production. Alongside Janux, Dual Drive will make their UK debut. Londoner's Motek are known for putting on some of the best undeground parties in London and bringing in genuine talent to DJ - and Ben Coda, Matt Hardinge and Wez Saunders will respectively be providing beats on the night.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Supernova &amp; Relation keep supplying the Techno soundtrack to what has now become a monthly "randez vous".</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;For September's Supernova party, we once again join forces with the Relations collective (following two showcases with Desolat and Cadenza), and Freak for a specially themed Rimini meets Berlin extravaganza featuring Italy's legendary house music maestro, DJ Ralf and Berlin's Get Physical star, Siopis. Several other special guests will be making an appearance alongside London's finest house/techno exponents. DJ RALF Considered as one of Italy's most acclaimed DJ's Ralf has been a Cocoric&#242; (Rimini) resident for many years now. In addition to Cocoric&#242; he regularly works with organizations such as the "Folies de Pigalle", "Colazione da Tiffany" - Italy's most famous and pioneering afterhours - Ibiza's "Made in Italy". During Milan fashion week he can be found at the turntables for DSquared2 fashion parade. Ralf own label "La Terra" was born in 2006 in order to give the chance of expression to friends and young up-and-coming producers. SIOPIS Jannis Siopis - son of greek alien employees - grew up in a small city, Gifhorn, where he was involved very early in the breakdance and graffiti scene. Getting really strong influences from Zapp, Prince Charles, Mtume and Johnny Guitar Watson, he started at an early age to get himself more and more in touch with music. A classical music education followed with trompet and clarinette. And soon the first big love of his live arrived: 1210. Greece and the beautiful islands in the Aegeis were the first places where you could hear his fresh style. Doing this he played almost in every club around Greek Islands and he decided it was time to move to &#8222;Electronic Music Metropolis" - Berlin. The Berlin-based DJ and producer has worked closely with the well-established M.A.N.D.Y, in venues across the globe. His naughty, cool and therefore seductive sound has been played at most attended of the house parties and dancefloors in London this year.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Celebrating real house music and all that it still stands for, &#8217;20 Years of House Music&#8217; brings together one of the most interesting line- ups of 2011. Quite possibly the last time that you will see all three house heads play together, Sunday 18th September presents CJ Mackintosh, Frankie Knuckles, David Morales all in the same room for the first time in years. Whether you call them pioneers, inventors or just damn good dj&#8217;s they sculpted the scene and still are to this day. This night is all about the friends of the club, so the doors open to regulars, past clubbers and anyone with an appreciation of house as an art form. With Farley &amp; Heller plus Claudio Coccoluto also added to the bill, it would be regrettable to miss out. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &#163;15 Advance // &#163;8 from 4am // Students &#163;10 All Night Tickets available from: http://www.ministryofsound&#8203;.com/tickets http://www.ticketweb.co.uk&#8203;/ // 08444 771 000 http://www.residentadvisor&#8203;.net/mos http://www.skiddle.com/mos _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ http://www.ministryofsound&#8203;.com/club http://www.youtube.com/min&#8203;istryofsoundclub http://www.facebook.com/mi&#8203;nistryofsoundclub http://www.twitter.com/mos&#8203;club _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Ministry of Sound 103 Gaunt Street London SE1 6DP 0870 060 0010 Nearest Tube: Elephant and CastleSee More&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

This is a great way to meet new people, have a laugh and get settled into uni life Why is it so good??? Well, where do you start? Dj Troy&#8221; student guru" Mead knows just how to mix it up, from club classics, DnB, Dub Step right through to student favourites and beyond into party classics. If you want it played he has got it and he will mix it into Wednesday night...JUST FOR YOU. Nearly every drink is &#163;2 ALL NIGHT, so come blow off your loan (drinks that cheap u might even manage a kebab on the way home) Every week we have a different form of entertainment, foam party, UV Party, fancy dress, baked bean wrestling, rodeo riding, truly a student night! 2011 sees us launching with the Fresher&#8217;s foam party, this is not just any foam party this is a McCluskys foam party. Two of the biggest foam cannons in England will be there; we are talking foamy females and most males with foam waist high, this is a night that can not be missed.

One thing that&#8217;s for sure is that Ryan Elliott is always in it, right near the top. Ever since we saw him totally outclass Richie and Ricardo at Sonar a few years ago we&#8217;ve always been hyped to see his name on a flyer. He&#8217;s technically flawless; cutting and switching in and out of tracks with the speed of a hip-hop DJ but with the seamless blending abilities of someone like Hawtin at his best. He can draw for classic house music, dub techno, Mills-style-bangers, Audion freak-outs and the deepest Berghain/Panorama grooves across 3 decks whilst making the whole thing hang like it was put together in Logic. Two years of living in Berlin, playing his monthly Panorama Bar residency and travelling round Europe&#8217;s techno hot spots have finely tuned his record collection and dance floor instincts. If you like quality club music, then you don&#8217;t want to miss this. Joining Ryan on the night.. Luke Black (Organic Art Movement) Lookleft &amp; Bearight (Boe Digits/Release Sustain) Make Me residents.... Rubin, Rupes, Nic Baird&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;West London&#8217;s legendary monthly acid house retrospective welcomes a live electro acid set from Transparent Sound&#8217;s &#8220;Orson Bramley&#8221;, Gescom DJ Rob Hall, as well as sets from residents AGT Rave Cru and Placid. Orson Bramley aka Transparent Sound Best known as the founder of the UK&#8217;s electro funk pioneers Transparent Sound and Orson Records, Orson has forged himself a deadly reputation as both producer and DJ &amp; live act. You can usually find him gracing the stage at venues &amp; festivals such as Fabric, Dance Valley, Sonar, and Burning Man. His work has seen him perform at the Tate Modern Gallery, and he&#8217;s even remixed such luminaries as The Cure. His latest release, Inverted Snobbery 1988, released in the summer of 2011 has been picking up plaudits for it&#8217;s combination of dancefloor sensibilities drawing from the likes of Orbital and Plaid. Check it here to hear what to expect: http://soundcloud.com/transparent-sound/1988-1 ROB HALL Notorious underground DJ and part of the Gescom collective, Rob&#8217;s debut DJ set was with Autechre at Megatripolis, Heaven, in the summer of 1992. Since then, Rob has been at the forefront of the electronic music scene playing records as far afield as California, London, Reykjavick, Barcelona and Athens and often sharing the same billing as respected artists such as Jeff Mills, The Advent, Bjork and the Aphex Twin. He has past held DJ residencies at Estatici in New York, toured the world with Autechre several times, and played just about everywhere, from The Liquid Rooms in Tokyo, festivals such as Sonar and BLOC, to word-of-mouth parties with the Skam crew in Manchester. www.rob-hall.co.uk AGT Rave Cru The Chas and Dave of Rave, AGT run at a hundred-tracks-an-hour on stage, mashing up rave anthems, acid house, warehouse basslines, old skool classics, 80&#8242;s electro, hardcore jungle, and whatever else happens to be tickling them at the time&#8230; all at lightning speed without ever missing a beat. Firmly tongue-in-cheek, like a hyperactive 2manydjs meets Altern8 in Orbital glasses and hi-viz vests &#8211; it might not always be clever: but it certainly is BIG. Check out this video of AGT rocking the I Love Acid dome at BLOC Weekend: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2w9BLI0Kuc PLACID The &#8220;DJ&#8217;s DJ&#8221; and reputed owner of one of the worlds most encompassing collections of acid house, I Love Acid resident, walking acid-house encyclopedia Placid once again digs deep into his crate to bring you a pure vinyl set of the absolute best of acid house, Detroit techno, retro electro and Chicago house. www.acid-house.net www.iheartacid.com www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2401566888 www.myspace.com/iloveacidclub www.flickr.com/photos/iloveacid/ www.ginglik.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>Saturday 24th September sees London&#8217;s finest disco venue hosting an all night two-floor party until 6am welcoming a guest
who is becoming nothing short of a modern legend: Norwegian disco king, Todd Terje
</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Dear press Saturday 24th September sees London&#8217;s finest disco venue hosting an all night two-floor party until 6am welcoming a guest who is becoming nothing short of a modern legend: Norwegian disco king, Todd Terje. We&#8217;re absolutely over the moon to be hosting a rare UK date from the man behind the current dancefloor bomb &#8216;Ragysh&#8217;, who will be supported downstairs by Horse &amp; Groom stalwarts and pioneers of London&#8217;s own disco scene, Lasermagnetic. On top of that, upstairs the brilliant Boogie Cartel return to the scene of their very first electrifying parties, with residents playing all night long - this cannot be missed. We&#8217;re even opening up the intimate boudoir where party crew Ears Have Eyes will spin tunes under the notorious red light. This looks to go down as yet another legendary night at the Shoreditch disco pub. Following a string of celebrated releases leaning on everything from kitschy Euro sounds to dub disco and psychedelic house, Todd Terje made his mark within dance music circuits. Gems such as the cheese anthem &#8220;Eurodans&#8221; and the Latin disco fuelled edit of Jacko&#8217;s &#8220;Can&#8217;t Help it&#8221; under his Tangoterje edit-moniker instantly made industry types and clubbers alike go bananas, and made him to everybody's darling from Gilles Peterson to Pete Tong. Inspired by the former UK generation of disco heads such as Idjut Boys, Black Cock etc, Terje soon began to make his own re-edits of old disco records to make them more suitable for his dancers. But instead of just adding a bass drum and remove some vocals, he injected musicality and playfulness for a more personal twist. Cheesy pop artists such as The Bee Gee&#8217;s, Michael Jackson, Chris Rea, Wham, Paul Simon, America or Chic didn't turn him off, as &#8220;there&#180;s nothing wrong with grandiose pop if there&#180;s an equal amount of dub to it&#8221;, edit rule number one. This untraditional approach made him the King Midas of edits and he reinvented the whole edit genre almost all by himself. The venue is primed and ready for an all night disco extravaganza. The soundsystem has been tweaked to perfection, we&#8217;ve ensured a 6am license and we&#8217;ve got some of the finest party crews around keeping the two floors heaving until sunrise. The Horse and Groom&#8217;s ethos of putting on the biggest and best names in the intimate confines of the traditional East End pub has earned the venue legendary status. Just ask Mr C, Jamie Jones or Eric Duncan , who have all had the place heaving over the last year. Now it&#8217;s time for the man behind some of the finest tunes and edits of our time to take the stage and make sure our reputation as the finest place for disco in London is preserved&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Coloursound - Launch Event Stacey Pullen (Blackflag Recordings, Detroit) Tiefschwarz (Basti) (Souvenir) Round Table Knights (Made To Play) Jordan Peak (Saved) Huxley (Cecille) Russ Yallop (Crosstown Rebels) Richy Ahmed (Hot Creations) Darius Syrossian (VIVa MUSiC) Cera Alba (Hot Natured) After months of research and planning, bold new club concept Coloursound is launching on September 24th at rejuvenated and legendary Leeds venue The Warehouse. The first party in a series which will switch up venues and musical styles, from cosy to massive, house to techno, is to be headlined by Stacey Pullen, Tiefschwarz, Darius Syrossian, Jordan Peak, Russ Yallop, Richy Ahmed and Huxley. The venue is the refurbished Warehouse - complete with new Funktion One sound, lighting and bars - is off on a mission to recapture its former glories and Colousound is the perfect partner to help it do that. Growing up under the stewardship of Detroit's legendary three - Derrick May, Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson - the Motor City's musical credentials live strong in headliner Stacey Pullen. As a DJ and producer for the last 20 years, he has crafted some seminal record's, played some unforgettable gigs and always has his quality threshold remained as high as anyone's. First to join him will be Souvenir label bosses, fabric mix CD entrants and genre defining underground pair, Tiefschwarz. Over more than a decade in the game, the German pair have released a number of seminal albums and dark, twisted house and techno mixes making them undisputed champions of the scene. Russ Yallop and Richie Ahmed, meanwhile, are from the new school of slow and sexy house as run by Hot Creations for whom they most often release. Dance music never sounded as honest, emotional and fun as it does in the hands of these guys&#8230; Someone with a longer and close association to VIVA Records is Leeds producer, label boss at Breakout Audio and former record store owner Darius. His records get lapped up by the likes of Radio 1&#8217;s Heidi and the Dutch tech house crew (Julian Chaptal, Lauhaus etc) and his DJ sets have won him fans all over Europe, America and beyond. Closing things out are rising star Jordan Peak whose made a name for himself releasing retro tinged, deep tech for the likes of One Records and Tsuba, and London based deep houser Huxley who counts Suara Music, Cecille and Freerange as his friends. Bringing a real sense of scale and musical depth to the city, Coloursound is a bold new project bringing together all different parts of the Leeds scene under one roof&#8230; get excited.

RE:JOICE and let&#8217;s celebrate the songs that formed the soundtrack to your youth.

TECHNICOLOUR Episode III
The Cinematographic House Music Experience featuring Ramon Tapia [Great Stuff//Herzblut]&amp; Alex Bau [CLR//Credo]</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Summer, oh that beautiful surreal dream we've all had for the past three months... London has truly blossomed with more new music, more new artists and more colourful people on its dancefloors than ever before. Or so we've seen... The second episode in the TECHNICOLOUR series surely had variety, diversity and mind tripping visuals to get everyone into a lively mood. And what did you think about the mini beach complete with sand, sun umbrellas and exotic cocktails set up in the club's garden?! The EGG crew surprised us all we must say. Now that the summer story has just completed its last chapter for this year, we are entering autumn, a season that brings with it a different type of romance, with more grey skies and sometimes windy sunshine, but also with a richness and colour like no other. September is a month caught in between, oscillating between summery open skies to heavy grey autumn rains. For this month's episode of TECHNICOLOUR we have a very fitting mixture of hot Southern grooves and inciting Northern beats. All complemented with mind blowing visuals and video edits from our "mind-blowing engineer" They Said They Saw&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

Keeping the AIM of Brickbeat of discovering new talented artists around the world, the second guest of the night will be Himan, a young producer from Lisbon, already released by labels as Connaisseur, Safari Numerique, Galaktica and many more.

  <short_description>Coloursound 002 - Manchester Launch at Soundcontrol</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Kenny Larkin Kevin Saunderson (KMS Records) Lee Foss (Hot Natured) Levon Vincent (Novel Sound) Fred P AKA Black Jazz Consortium more acts to be announced &#8220;Never has so much, been expected by so many, of so few&#8221; is how you could describe the weeks of mass anticipation leading up to the second Coloursound event, this time at Manchester&#8217;s small but raw and future styled Sound Control on October 15th. Having gotten off to a sellout start first time round, Coloursound will once again come true on all their promises with another hefty line-up of talent, this time from a techno and house mould. Kenny Larkin headlines &#8211; a man who&#8217;s colourful character always comes out in his seminal house and techno records and has done for years. Someone just as instrumental to the development of techno over the decades is Kevin Saunderson. Another member of the Belleville Three, Sauderson&#8217;s legacy is ever secured thanks to his membership of Inner City whose seminal hit &#8216;Good Life&#8217; will never grow old. As well as on his own legendary techno label KMS, Saunderson releases on Planet E among many others. Offering a lighter take on electronic music will be Lee Foss, the Hot Creations boss - alongside pal Jamie Jones &#8211; who has reinvented a certain strain of disco fuelled, vocal, sexy and slo-mo house music for labels like LA Culprit as well as his own and is a party starting DJ like few others today. He plays all over the world from fabric to WMC as well as cool underground parties like Lo*Key in London. And so to US deep experimenter Levon Vincent who&#8217;s smoky, basement aligned house and techno is perfect for late night dancing. His DJ diary takes him all over the world, whilst his records find homes on his own Novel Sound as well as connoisseur imprints like Underground Quality and Ostgut Ton. Finally, it will be deepest house exponent Fred P AKA Black Jazz Consortium who completes the line-up. Recording for a wide range of labels over the last 20 years - most notably Underground Quality headed by the legendary DJ Jus Ed - Fred P has gained a following of true deep house lovers the world over. Always touring the globe as a unique contributor to this genre, his albums and singles are always well received, as are his oh-so impressive DJ sets. Tom Craven and James Cotterill of Illusion Recordings close out a very tasteful party with their own connoisseur selections. Ticket prices: &#163;8 &#8211; Super early bird &#163;12 &#8211; Early bird &#163;15 &#8211; Advanced tickets &#163;20 on the door Season ticket - &#163;85 &#8211; entry to all Coloursound events including afterparties &#8211; (Full season &#163;140 if bought separately) Buy tickets from August 1st from 10am http://www.residentadvisor.net http://coloursound.ticketarena.co.uk http://www.skiddle.com You can buy paper tickets from Crash, Jumbo LEEDS.

  <short_description>Coloursound 003 - Cadenza Warehouse Party at The Warehouse feat. Reboot, Robert Dietz, Argy, Mayaan Nidam, Darius Syrossian (VIVa MUSiC), Cera Alba</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Reboot Robert Dietz Argy Mayaan Nidam Darius Syrossian (VIVa MUSiC) Cera Alba Returning to Leeds for the third ever Coloursound party, this event at legendary and recently refurbished Leeds venue The Warehouse will come hand in hand with one of the biggest techno labels in the world&#8230; Luciano&#8217;s Cadenza. The scene is set, then, for a proper techno party in an appropriately atmospheric space with a fittingly powerful Funktion One Soundsystem on hand to supply the stylish sounds&#8230; First up from the label will be Reboot &#8211; the German tech specialist whose loopy sounds have seen him become one of the most in demand DJs of the day. Fusing fluttery Latin vibes with tribal beats, he plays all over Europe, the US and Ibiza to adoring fans every time. Next, close Cadenza chum Robert Dietz is a firm favourite in clubs around the globe who is on an incessant world tour that sees him flit through Pacha, Ibiza; Dance Valley, Amsterdam; Revolver, Australia; Arma17, Moscow; London&#8217;s ultra-hip underground Shoreditch warehouse parties and a second south America Tour in November this year. His sound is a tasty take on tech house that favours the uses of analogue machinery for real warmth. As does Wolf + Lamb and Perlon producer Maayan Nidam. It's impossible to reduce Mayaan's productions and DJ sets to a single sound, but certain qualities prevail: a looping, swinging, hips-and-ass-friendly sense of the groove; a bubbling sense of funk; a keen sense of timbre and tone colour, with a woolly low end and crystalline highs. Her sounds will get you dancing, but in the most sultry and sexy way possible. Grecian Argy has been recording for years and Cocoon, Raum and Pokerflat have all come for his powerful, metallic tech productions in that time. Through his natural talent for mixing in-key and constantly searching out the finest grooves, his DJ sets know no musical boundaries so Argy excels in creating a real party soundscape that works perfectly with his bold image to ensure his performances are something refreshingly different in the current club world. Closing out this festival sized warehouse gathering will be Coloursound resident Cera Alba who&#8217;ll bring some much needed steamy funk and house constructs to the table.

  <short_description>Coloursound 004: Don&#8217;t Panic presents... at A Nation Of Shopkeepers feat. DJ Derek, Murkage LIVE, Extra Curricular LIVE, Foz, Bangerang Djs</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Don&#8217;t Panic presents&#8230;&#8230; Special Headliner to be announced DJ Derek Murkage LIVE Extra Curricular LIVE Foz Bangerang Djs Taking over the cosy inner city space that is Nation of Shopkeepers, Don&#8217;t Panic presents is a very special party with a secret headliner to be announced closer the time&#8230; Playing with him on the night will be DJ Derek who is a Bristol-based DJ whose blend of 60s rocksteady, reggae, ska, dancehall and soul music has made him an icon for many in the industry, including a host of Jamaican producers and Massive Attack. The Murkage Cartel meanwhile are a collective of DJs, artists and promoters. The Cartel consists of 16 DJs, producers, hosts and promoters, and are most strongly linked with the club night Murkage, which was previously held in No.1 club. When the No.1 club shut, Murkage put out 4 epic nights known as the Murkage 4 which featured performances from David Rodigan, Boy Better Know, Bar9 and AC Slater. Tonight they play live, as does a hip hop and soul group from Huddersfield, Extra Curricular. Fronted by Jack Flash (MC), Ruby Wood (Vocals), and Thabo Mkwananzi (Vocals), the group also features a live horn section, turntables and samplers, alongside electric guitar, bass, and drums. Formed from an exclusive after-hours jam club, Extra Curricular have been pushing their unique brand of soul-driven hip hop music on the UK live circuit since early 2009 and recently signed to DJ Doorly&#8217;s Pigeonhole This! label. Finally, local DJ and promoter Foz will round off what is sure to be one of the most eclectic parties of the year at the indoor/outdoor space that is Nation of Shopkeepers. Ticket Prices: &#163;5 - Early birds &#163;8 - General admission Season ticket - &#163;85 &#8211; entry to all Coloursound events including afterparties &#8211; (Full season &#163;140 if bought separately) Ticket Outlets: Buy tickets from August 1st from 10am http://www.residentadvisor.net http://coloursound.ticketarena.co.uk http://www.skiddle.com You can buy paper tickets from Crash, Jumbo LEEDS.

  <short_description>Coloursound 005 - Goes Underground at Wire, Leeds feat. A Guy Called Gerald, Maurice Fulton, Tom Trago, Death On The Balcony </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;A Guy Called Gerald (Acid House Set) Maurice Fulton (Bubbletease Communications) Tom Trago (Rush Hour) Death On The Balcony Coloursound 005 - Coloursound goes Underground November 11th sees Coloursound cater to a more cosy and intimate vibe, this time taking their lucid party concept to the wine cellar like basement of Leeds club Wire. It has Funktion One sound, red brick walls, exposed beams and the lowest of low ceilings&#8230; all perfect for an up close and personal session with some electronic greats. First up is Manchester&#8217;s legendary A Guy Called Gerald&#8230;. Well, where do you start? He&#8217;s a hidden gem, the gateway between Chicago house and Detroit techno and one of a few special producers who entered dance music in the jacking zone. He was arguably the first UK acid house producer (and as such his special acid house set on the night is a real treat) and probably the first producer to have two instrumental dance tracks in the UK charts at the same. His collaborations stem from Frankie Knuckles, Goldie, Finley Quaye and Derrick May through to many more pillars of the dance music community. Quite simply, the man&#8217;s a legend. Also on is Maurice Fulton, one of house music&#8217;s true originals, an eccentric ex-pat American (currently living in Sheffield) DJ and producer who never fails to surprise and delight his listeners with records on Warp, Sonar, production credits for DFA and as part of pop act Mu with his wife. Next we turn to Holland and Rush Hour man Tom Trago. As well as various high profile remixes in his ten year career, Trago makes confident strides between dance and pop on his most recent records. There are elements of disco and hip-hop, too, as well as plenty of vocals, in the man&#8217;s records, so expect much the same from one of his DJ sets. Local Leeds stars Death on the Balcony &#8211; whose deep and techy productions have been gaining more and more support recently - round off another all conquering Coloursound line-up. DETAILS Ticket prices: &#163;8 &#8211; Super early bird &#163;12 &#8211; Advanced &#163;15 &#8211; OTD Season ticket - &#163;85 &#8211; entry to all Coloursound events including afterparties &#8211; Buy tickets from RA.

  <short_description>Coloursound 007: An Evening With Kenny Dope - Sat 3rd Dec // Joshua Brooks.  </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;This episode of Coloursound is to play out in Manchester, at the literally underground venue that is Joshua Brooks on Dec 3rd. Your one host for four straight hours on the evening will be the enigmatic house hero that is Kenny Dope. Kenny &#8216;Dope&#8217; Gonzalez is truly deserving of legendary status when it comes to house DJs and producers. He started his DJ career in 1985 organizing neighbourhood block parties in his home of Brooklyn, New York, before getting into production. Since then, his solo seminal hits for Defected, BBE and Strictly Rhythm have helped define a whole genre, whilst his part in legendary house act Masters at Work has pretty much influenced an entire generation of record buyers. His Dj sets are legendary, too, joining the dots between all manner of house styles from Latin to funky through more tribal and plenty of vocal business. With a full 4 hours to play with, you can really expect the man to dig deep and stretch his musical legs&#8230; Aside from two warm up DJs, Kenny will be the only man playing on the night. The exposed wires, pillars and bricks of Joshua Brooks really make for a fantastically vibey atmosphere so make sure you don&#8217;t miss this fine opportunity for an extended up close and personal session with a real house master. Ticket prices: &#163;10 &#8211; early bird &#163;15 &#8211; Advanced tickets MOTD Buy tickets from RA.
