  <short_description>Scale and Other Asias join forces to present &#8216;Slice&#8217;, an international arts project which brings together local people and arts practitioners from Lahore and London. Thu 1 Sept- Thu 22 Sept</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Slice&#8217; takes as its starting point an imaginary line drawn from Liverpool Street Station in London to Central Station, Lahore. The first mile of the line at the Lahore end, and the first at the London end, will be studied by arts practitioners from each city. The works they make in response will be shown on a website (www.london-lahore.com or www.lahore-london.com) and also displayed as part of an exhibition in venues in London and Lahore. In addition to various visual artists from the UK and Pakistan, artists from a variety of other disciplines are involved. These include story-telling, poetry, dance, music and theatre. Works are currently in progress - projects being developed include: - A dance piece by Jonathan Watkins, a dancer and choreographer with the Royal Ballet, using a multi-storey car park. - A soundwork by Kashif Mohsin and Matthias Kispert - one of various Lahore-London collaborations. - A project looking at two trees - one growing out of a shrine in a Lahore and one in London with the graffiti 'I LOVE U'. The artists involved are Nida Bangash and Steve Rosenthal. - A performative drawing in the back streets near Liverpool Street Station, by the artists&#8217; collective - A new track by Conrad the Scoundral, a grime MC and producer. - A piece by local artist, theatre director and stage designer Paul Burgess, exploring his family's history in the area. - Community-centred work by British-Bangladeshi poet and story-teller Shamim Azad, working with people from a group meeting at The Brady Arts Centre, Whitechapel. - A project by the architect Zahra Hussein, looking at life on the periphery of the railway lines in central Lahore. The exhibition at Rich Mix will be an interactive, multi-disciplinary artwork that allows the public to experience work created for the project by selecting points on two maps - one showing the mile-long slice of Lahore, the other of London. &#8216;Slice&#8217; aims to encourage dialogue between two diverse cultures via the creation of new artwork that enters into dialogue with the social and physical fabric of two iconic, complex and historically linked cities. The project interrogates both the map-making strategies of Colonialism and the processes of human migration. It also builds a symbolic bridge between artists and communities from different cultures.

  <short_description>The concept behind the Cellular Shift collection has been inspired by the work of Neale Donald Walsch, Abraham- Hicks Foundation, featured in the film &amp; book the &#8216;Secret&#8217;. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The concept behind the Cellular Shift collection has been inspired by the work of Neale Donald Walsch, Abraham- Hicks Foundation, featured in the film &amp; book the &#8216;Secret&#8217;. The work is very much in line with universal laws and us being the creators of our own destiny. While I was reading the book called Conversation with God, I came across a paragraph were I was compelled to take immediate action and thus I created the four initial mosaics. I wanted the mosaics to be big, easy to read and repeatable. The script is inspired from old English, making the mosaics a mixture of traditional and contemporary. The intention is to showcase the Cellular Shift Mosaics; with the audience experiencing each sentence of seventeen times and at this point Cellular Shift takes place. The work of Abraham- Hicks Foundation suggests that, when we repeat an affirmation seventeen times, we start to shift the cells in our body and mind, consequently re-programme our essence. "At the time I was also learning the art of Islamic Pattern and this is also reflected in the Cellular Shift Mosaics. Each mosaic took approximately 80 hrs to complete. Materials consist of mosaic and ceramic tiles; stain glass; recycled Moroccan tea glasses and crockery; glass nuggets and mirror." Website: www.lovemosaic.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <short_description>&#8216;God&#8217;s Wars&#8217;, a solo exhibition by May Ayres, is a selection of ceramic meditations on war and peace from her 'War of Aggression' series, being  shown for the first time together at St John on Bethnal Green. </short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;&#8216;God&#8217;s Wars&#8217; by May Ayres finds a home in The Belfry and Vestibule of St John on Bethnal Green. This is the first time that these large ceramic works can be viewed together in her first solo exhibition since 1985. The exhibition presents meditations on war and peace selected from her 'War of Aggression' series, created out of anger and reflection over the last seven years. The pieces attempt to address the question - how might we retain our common humanity and memory in the face of such barbarism as now exists? &#8216;When words fail us, we need to look to the silence in order to find any answers&#8217;. The exhibition opens on Thursday 1st September as part of the Whitechapel Gallery's First Thursday program. Visitors will also be able to enjoy the interior of this Grade One-listed building designed by Sir John Soane and view the church's remarkable 'Stations of the Cross' by British artist Chris Gollon.&#8232;There will be a bar on the opening night.&#8232; Exhibition opening times: Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday 12 noon &#8211; 9pm and by arrangement. www.mayayres.com&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;Original London Graffiti Artist &#8216;Robbo&#8217; suffered a life threatening accident in April. He was put into an induced coma and is still in hospital receiving 24/7 care. Robbo&#8217;s resurgence came in 2099 when Banksy used an original 1985 Robbo wall piece on Regent&#8217;s Canal as the backdrop for his &#8216;Decorator hanging wall paper&#8217; taking away any remnants of the original artist&#8217;s name and forcing Robbo out of retirement and kick starting the &#8216;Real Graffiti&#8217; vs. &#8216;Street Art&#8217; debate. Despite feelings running high on both sides, one of the original contributors to London&#8217;s rich graffiti tapestry needs all our support.

  <short_description>Japanese contemporary artisans' exhibition, showcasing wide range of their exquisite design products at gallery@oxo, Oxo Tower Wharf, SE1 9PH from 15 September 2011 to 2 October 2011.</short_description>
  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;A new design project team "wagumi" launches its first exhibition Creative Connections to showcase exciting collaborations between British design and Japanese craftmanship. The exhibition shows the first collaborative product - a tote bag - a partnership between Japanese textile company Tanei and LIBERTY of London. The exhibition also shows a range of contemporary craft and applied art from all over Japan including laquer work, ceramics and metalware. The items are created by skilled crafts people who combine their knowledge of materials and design passed down from generation to generation with a contemporary twist. Tanei is a textile company from Mikawa, a famous cotton production area in Japan, and has been making hand-woven 'sashiko' fabric for over 100 years using their locally sourced cotton. Traditionally 'sashiko' has been used for clothing for firemen, fishermen and in the practise of martial arts. Now it provides the outer layer of a compact and multi-functional tote bag with LIBERTY fabric for the lining. This product will be exclusively for sale at the gallery. Part of London Design Festival.&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>

  <long_description>&lt;p&gt;The idea behind Capture Cure is to gather together art, which fans vote for on the Capture Cure Facebook Page. Those paintings (or photographs, illustrations sculptures) which get the most &#8216;like&#8217; responses are then displayed in an exhibition and auctioned off. Last year, we managed to get 70 works of art submitted &#8211; 35 then starred in the exhibition, attended by 130 people (we raised &#163;4,287).&lt;/p&gt;</long_description>
